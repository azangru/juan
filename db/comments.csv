3,"The first two cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| were published July 15, 1819. Because of its daring, irreverent, and “immoral” character, Byron’s publisher, John Murray, decided to publish it anonymously. Not only was the author’s name omitted, but even the publisher’s, for fear of legal reprisals. Byron, on hearing this was planned, asked that the dedication (in which he vehemently attacked Robert Southey) be omitted. Me might be abusive, even scurrilous, in his anger, but he was not cowardly. He said, “I won’t attack the dog in the dark. Such things are for scoundrels and renegados like himself.”
However, the dedication is said to have got into print somehow and to have been sold separately under the counter, so to speak. Southey was aware of its contents and must have been vastly discontented over them. Eventually, after Byron was dead, the dedication was restored to its place, and here it is — one of the most successful pieces of elaborate vilification in English poetry.",asimov
4,Robert Southey (1774–1843) was an English poet whose success far outstripped his talents. His best-known poems today remain |||italics|||The Battle of Blenheim|||/italics||| composed in 1798 and |||italics|||The Inchcape Rock|||/italics||| written somewhat later. Neither is very important. Byron hated him with a fervor that seemed but to increase with time (the hate was returned) and |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is dedicated to him with savage irony.,asimov
5,"The poet laureate is a court official appointed by the British Prime Minister. The poet laureate (“laureate” means decked with laurel and therefore honored, for in ancient Greece it was the custom to grant the winners at the Olympian games wreaths of laurel leaves) was supposed to write odes in honor of the monarch on his birthday and to celebrate other official occasions in similar fashion.
The poet laureate was by no means assuredly the best poet in the nation, for there were many who would be considered ineligible because their political views were unsuitable or their poetry unedifying. And the best poets often did not want a post which they viewed as that of the government’s tame poetic spaniel.
Nevertheless, the post brought in a little money and a great deal of prestige (with the non-poetic public) and, officially at least, the poet laureate might be considered the chief of British poets (hence “representative of all the race”).
Southey was the twelfth official poet laureate, having accepted the post in 1813, five years before this dedication was written. Byron had only contempt for the man and for the post, but that did not mean that he did not chafe at the fact that the public generally, in awe of the post, were consequently impressed by the man.",asimov
6,"The Tories were the conservative party of the nation (and modern Conservatives in Britain are still often referred to as Tories). They were the spokesmen of the landed gentry, of the established Church, of the Crown. In short, they represented what we would today call the Establishment.
Southey, in his youth, had been caught up (like many other young Englishmen of the time) in the revolutionary fervor that accompanied the French Revolution of 1789. With age, however, Southey became steadily more conservative and eventually became a pillar of the Tories and one of their most dependable spokesmen. In this respect, he was like a number of other literary figures who had been revolutionaries in their youth but who had hardened and yellowed with age and prosperity, so that Southey’s change had “lately been a common case”. Byron, who remained revolutionary and bitterly anti-Establishment to the end of his days, felt self-righteously superior to those he considered traitors to their youthful ideals, and his contempt for them knew no bounds.",asimov
7,"Southey, along with certain of the other poets-turned-conservative preached the joys of nature (safer, in a way, for conservatives, than considering the human condition) and made their home in the beautiful Lake District of Lancashire, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, just south of the Scottish border. They were referred to as the “Lake poets” and Byron converts that into the derisory “Lakers.”",asimov
8,"Since the Lakers were now conservative and sang the glories of King and Establishment, they might be compared to Mother Goose’s “four and twenty Blackbirds.” The use of the spelling “pye” is a reference to Henry James Pye, a particularly bad poet who had served as poet laureate from 1790 to 1813 and is otherwise a cipher in literary history. It was his death that put Southey in that seat, reflecting glory on his brother Lakers so that “Which pye being open’d they began to sing.”",asimov
9,"At the time Byron began |||italics|||Don Juan |||/italics|||in 1818, George III was still King of Great Britain and Ireland. He had by then been reigning for fifty-eight years, but had been subject to periods of mental imbalance and after 1811 had been permanently insane. His eldest son, Prince George, was officially declared Regent in 1811. The Prince Regent was a most licentious man, which in itself Byron would scarcely have objected to. However, as Prince of Wales, he had been at continual odds with his father and had therefore allied himself with the liberal Whigs. Once he became Regent, however, he broke with the Whigs and aligned himself with the Tories. He might therefore be expected to “admire such kind of food,” i. e., the praise of other renegades.",asimov
10,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), unlike Southey, is recognized today (at his best) one of the giants among the poets. He is known today for the magnificent |||italics|||Rime of the Ancient Mariner|||/italics||| (1798) and |||italics|||Kubla Khan|||/italics||| (1797). Byron sympathized with the chronically impoverished Coleridge and had helped him financially and with recommendations. However, Coleridge, who had been liberal in his youth, also turned conservative in religion and in politics. Worse yet, from Byron’s standpoint, he was and remained a friend of Southey’s and no friend of Southey could be anything but a target for Byron’s ridicule.
Coleridge, in middle age, grew interested in German philosophy. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant had published his |||italics|||Critique of Pure Reason|||/italics||| in 1781 and introduced in it a system of thought called “transcendentialism.” Coleridge, in his |||italics|||Biographia Literaria|||/italics|||, published in 1817, was the first to undertake an explanation of this to the English-speaking world.",asimov
11,"Kant’s philosophy is notoriously difficult to understand, all the more so since it was written in the very best German-opaque. Coleridge, for all his ability to handle English, didn’t succeed in making it much clearer.",asimov
12,“A dry Bob” seems to have been then-current slang for intercourse without ejaculation (“lack of moisture”). The use of the phrase shocked and (of course) titillated the public and was a particularly effective way of indicating that Southey went through the motions of writing poetry without producing anything poetic.,asimov
13,"William Wordsworth (1770–1850) was the most successful English poet of his time. His publications of |||italics|||Lyrical Ballads|||/italics||| in 1798, in collaboration with Coleridge, was a landmark in English literary history, Like Coleridge and Southey, he was a radical in his youth and grew conservative with success.
In 1790 he settled in Grasmere in the Lake Country and remained there for the rest of his life. It was round him that the other Lake poets gathered.",asimov
14,"Although many of Wordsworth’s youthful poems are first-class, he wrote himself out by the time he was forty, and the last half of his long life shows only occasional flashes of power. His long poem |||italics|||The Excursion,|||/italics||| published in 1814, shows none of them and was almost entirely pedestrian. Nevertheless, Wordsworth lived to succeed Southey as poet laureate in 1843, something that would have stirred Byron’s profoundest disgust, had he lived to see it.",asimov
15,"The “dog-star” is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky (so-called because it is in the constellation Canis Major, or Great Dog). It rises close to dawn during the months of July and August and, in ancient times, was thought to radiate a significant quantity of heat, thus making those months particularly hot. This is not so, of course, but the hottest part of summer is still referred to as the “dog days”. Since great heat can induce sunstroke and can, even short of that, make anyone snappish and unreasonable, men were supposed to be more likely to go mad during the dog days. Hence Byron’s comment implies that only madmen would consider Wordsworth’s |||italics|||Excursion|||/italics||| to be poetry.",asimov
16,"The Tower of Babel was an attempt, according to the Bible, to raise a building high enough to scale heaven (Genesis 11:1–9). It is therefore the epitome of the skyscraper and to add another story to it is a way of signifying the impossible. In punishment for the attempt to build the Tower, those planning the structure were stricken by God with a confusion of tongues so that there is also the secondary implication that |||italics|||The Excursion|||/italics||| is incoherent.",asimov
17,"Keswick is the chief town of the Lake District. Coleridge lived there from 1800 to 1809, and Southey lived there all his life after 1803. Wordsworth lived only twelve miles to the south.",asimov
18,"Byron had traveled all over Europe (and was indeed, at the time he wrote this, living in Venice in permanent exile from his native land). He could not help sneering at the Lake poets for their narrow provincialism as compared with himself.",asimov
19,"It is not unknown for some person who has been of worth to the nation in the arts or sciences to be given some sinecure in the bureaucracy, to serve as a source of money and prestige. In 1813 Wordsworth was awarded the Distributorship of Stamps for the county of Westmoreland. The stamps were used as a method of taxation, hence “his place in the Excise.” Naturally, it made Wordsworth a mark for liberals like Byron who affected to believe it was for that salary that he had gone over to the Conservative side and, for fear of losing it, that he remained there.",asimov
20,"Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832) was a Scottish poet whose success came with |||italics|||The Lay of the Last Minstrel,|||/italics||| published in 1805, which contains the great set of patriotic lines that begins “Breathes there a man with soul so dead...” Byron wrote satirically at Scott’s expense in his youth, but the good-natured Scott returned pleasant words for unkind ones, and in the end they were good friends, even though Scott was, and remained, a Tory. Scott was lame from an attack of poliomyelitis in babyhood and this may have helped endear him to the self-consciously clubfooted Byron. Scott was offered the laureateship on the death of Pye, but he refused it, something which also counted in his favor as far as Byron was concerned.",asimov
21,"Samuel Rogers (1763–1855) was quite a second-rate poet, whose only literary fame came with the publication of |||italics|||The Pleasures of Memory|||/italics||| in 1792. The phrase “Not dead but gone before,” seen on many a tombstone now, is his. He was a kindly gentleman who gave good parties, was financially generous to other poets, and was a friend of Byron’s. He lived long enough to be offered the laureateship on Wordsworth’s death but refused it, and no doubt the shade of Byron approved.",asimov
22,"Thomas Campbell (1777–1844) was a Scottish poet who wrote patriotic verse (|||italics|||Ye Mariners of England,|||/italics||| 1800) and ballads (|||italics|||Lord Ullin’s Daughter, |||/italics|||1804). He was, and remained, a liberal, not only supporting the French Revolution, but also denouncing the partition of Poland and inveighing against Negro slavery. He received a pension from the Crown in 1803, but apparently Byron didn’t mind that. He and Rogers (see note 21) were about the only contemporary British writers never to suffer shafts of Byronic satire.",asimov
23,"Thomas Moore (1779–1852) was an Irish poet whose first fame came with |||italics|||Odes of Anacreon,|||/italics||| published in 1800. Some of the verses he wrote to “traditional airs” are still well-known: |||italics|||The Harp That Once Through Tara’s Halls; Believe Me, If Those Endearing Young Charms; The Last Rose of Summer; |||/italics|||and so on.
Byron’s early ridicule drove Moore to demand a duel, but Byron made good-humored amends. Thereafter, Byron always admired Moore, and the admiration was returned. Moore’s most successful work in his own time was |||italics|||Lalla Rookh|||/italics||| (1817) and that was written in Byronic style. He visited Byron during the latter’s exile in Italy ans even though Moore advised against publication of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| because of its ribaldry, their friendship remained close. Byron left him his memoirs to publish, but Moore (in an attack of unforgivable prudence) decided to burn them. In 1830, though, he used information that survived to publish |||italics|||Letters and Journals of Lord Byron|||/italics||| which included a biography.",asimov
24,"George Crabbe (1754–1832) achieved fame only late in life. He was a nature poet, like the Lakers, but preferred to be realistic and not merely sentimental. Of this, Byron approved.",asimov
25,"The result of the trial would not have pleased Byron, alas. None of the poets named in this verse, despite Byron’s approval, were destined to compete with Wordsworth and Coleridge in the eyes of posterity, though Scott at least probably transcends Southey.",asimov
26,"The Muses were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (memory) in the Greek myths. In the days before writing was common, epic poetry and other forms of literary endeavor were transmitted by word of mouth and had to be committed to memory. A correct recitation was the daughter of memory so it was natural for a poet to invoke the Muse before launching into a large effort. Eventually, nine Muses were listed, each for a special branch of art. As a result, “muse” became a metaphor for poetic inspiration and Byron, with only mock modesty, you may be sure, speaks of his own as pedestrian.",asimov
27,"Pegasus was a winged horse in Greek myth. According to one tale, Pegasus once alighted upon Mount Helicon, the traditional home of the Muses, and where his foot struck, a spring appeared, since called Hippocrene (horse-fountain). The waters of Hippocrene, through association with Helicon and the Muses, became symbolic of the bubbling upward of poetic inspiration. By further association, Pegasus, soaring high above the earth on his beautiful wings, became the symbol of the flight of poetry. Byron’s irony places the Lake poets on Pegasus in contrast to his own “pedestrian Muse.”",asimov
28,"It is obvious that Byron emphatically does not follow his own advice, but then few people do.",asimov
29,"The Greek god of the sun, Helios, was the son of Hyperion, who was one of the Titans, a group of gods who ruled the universe before Zeus and his fellow Olympians took over. The sun can be referred to, poetically, as Helios, or Hyperion, or, as in this case, Titan.",asimov
30,"John Milton (1608–1674) was greatly admired by Byron. For one thing, Milton was a revolutionary in his time. He was the great Puritan poet and he was on the side of Parliament in its war with King Charles I that began in 1642. His eloquent pen wrote in defense of the Parliamentary cause even to the justification of the execution of Charles in 1649. The shadows gathered, however. His eyesight failed, and in 1652, before his forty-fourth birthday, he was totally blind. In 1661 the monarchy was restored and those who returned to power accused Milton of treason. For a while he was in actual danger of his life.
In 1663, at the very nadir of his fortunes, he completed |||italics|||Paradise Lo|||/italics||||||italics|||st,|||/italics||| the greatest serious epic poem in English literary history (as |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is the greatest comic one). At the midpoint of the poem, near the beginning of Book VII, Milton wrote:
|||comment-quote|||...I sing with mortal voice, unchanged
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
On evil days though fallen and evil tongues,
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
And solitude...|||/comment-quote|||
No doubt, Byron saw in this a comparison to his own situation, exiled from England and execrated for his irregular way of life by the pious hypocrites (so he considered them) he had left behind.",asimov
31,"In 1660, when the English were getting ready to bring back Charles I’s son to reign as Charles II, Milton wrote a pamphlet denouncing such a restoration, knowing full well that if that restoration succeeded (and it looked very much as though it would) he might be executed. He did not “loathe the Sire [Charles I] to laud the Son [Charles II]” but remained constant to his views — something Byron contrasts to the actions of Southey and the others.",asimov
32,"Samuel was the Old Testament prophet who first anointed Saul king of Israel and then broke with him. In the crisis of Saul’s life just before a climactic battle with the Philistines, Saul tried to raise the spirit of the dead Samuel (I Samuel 28:7–20) to gain guidance. When Samuel was raised, however, he horrified Saul by predicting defeat and death for him.",asimov
33,"Milton’s last years were spent not only with blindness, but with gout and poverty. The legend arose that his daughters were heartless and cruel to him, but it may well have been that he himself was captious and overly demanding.",asimov
34,"Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769–1822), was Foreign Secretary from 1812 to 1822. In the years following Waterloo, he kept Great Britain on the side of those Continental monarchies who attempted to crush the forces of liberalism in Europe. This made him anathema to the English liberals, and no one was more vivid in execrations against him than Byron was. He was also identified with repressive policies at home.
Byron’s phrase “intellectual eunuch” is double-barreled. He might well be impugning Castlereagh’s intelligence and it is true that Castlereagh was a bad orator and therefore sounded stupid at times. The phrase might refer more literally to a real or fancied hyposexuality, for through his long marriage of thirty-five years, Castlereagh had no child. This second implication is reinforced by Byron’s deliberate use of “its” for “his” in the succeeding verses.",asimov
35,"Castlereagh’s father was an Irish landowner, and his own first public office was in the Irish parliament in 1790. He became chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1798, and played a key role in the firm suppression of an Irish rebellion in that year. British fright at the prospect of a French landing in Ireland made the repression a bloody one and Castlereagh was gladly handed the blame for that by the liberals.",asimov
36,"Castlereagh left Ireland in 1805, to take up his first post in the British cabinet as Secretary of War.",asimov
37,"After the defeat of Napoleon, Castlereagh supported the reactionary policies initiated by Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria though Castlereagh’s secret diplomacy (unknown to the liberals) served to soften the harsh intentions of the Continental powers.",asimov
38,"Ixion was punished, in Greek myth, for his attempt to rape the goddess Hera by being tied to a fiery wheel that turned endlessly in Tartarus, that part of the underworld reserved for the torture of those who angered the gods. Ixion’s wheel is thus a poetic metaphor for the “endless torments and perpetual motion” to which Byron compares Castlereagh’s droning and uncertain oratory.",asimov
39,"The reactionary policies of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, under their guiding spirit, Metternich, did not, in the years after Waterloo, successfully prevent all expression of liberalism. The Congress of Vienna (1814) had marked out the map of Europe as it was to be after Napoleon, but Castlereagh tried to institute a regular system of periodic meetings of the great powers to take up emergencies that might arise. This dim preview of a League of Nations was mocked by Byron as indicating that the reactionaries couldn’t settle things once and for all, but had to keep patching. Indeed, even as this dedication was being written, the powers were meeting in the first postwar congress at Aix-la-Chapelle, on the western boundaries of Prussia, to consider methods for uplifting France from the outcast role she had been placed in after Waterloo and restoring her to her position as a great power.",asimov
40,"Here, again, the matter of the “intellectual eunuch” is brought up, for Castlereagh’s mind is “emasculated to the marrow”. Eutropius was a eunuch, literally, who served as a minister to the East Roman Emperor Arcadius from 395 to 398. His reputation in history was that of a vile and corrupt intriguer and he came to a bad end, being executed in 399. (Castlereagh also came to a bad end, perhaps even more tragic, four years after these words were written. Byron could not know that now — though he might hope.)",asimov
41,"No one could doubt Castlereagh’s physical courage; that was proved many times. In 1809 he fought a duel with his political rival (and eventual successor) George Canning and wounded him, thus fulfilling the ritualistic display of courage the times required. But to Byron, unwilling to allow Castlereagh any virtues at all, courage, too, becomes a vice.",asimov
42,"During the Napoleonic era, Italy was freed from its old Australian-dominated dynasties and new states were set up which were in theory free, but were actually dominated by France. Byron accepted that theory and could look back a few years and refer to Italy’s “late reviving Roman soul.” After the defeat of Napoleon, the domination was turned back from France to Austria, and now it was the reactionaries of Europe who considered Italy free. |||italics|||This|||/italics||| time the theory is a “lie” to Byron.
Talk of freedom must have seemed particularly ridiculous to Byron since Lombardy and Venetia which, before Napoleon’s time, had been independent states, were now made part of the Austrian Empire. Byron had come to Italy in the fall of 1817 and it was in Venice (now part of Austria) that he wrote the dedication and the first two cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||.",asimov
43,The “buff and blue” were colors used in the uniforms of those associated with the Whig Club and came to be the badge of the liberal party of the Whigs.,asimov
44,Hercules was the giant strong man of Greek mythology and the very personification of brute strength. “Herculean” refers to anything that requires the strength of a Hercules.,asimov
45,"Julian (331–363) was a Roman emperor from 361 to 363. Although the emperors had been Christian for a generation and Julian had himself been brought up a Christian and had pretended to be one, he doffed that religion once he became emperor. He revealed himself a pagan an did his best to revive paganism as a force within the empire. In this he failed, and his reign represented the last attempt to stem the Christian tide. Later Christian historians referred to him as “Julian the Apostate” (an apostate being one who abandons the cause he had at one time supported). Byron’s final slap at Southey, then, is to make him “Ultra-Julian,” that is worse than Julian in his apostasy.
The dedication, which here ends, was completed on September 16, 1818.",asimov
46,"Canto I was written between September 6 and November 1, 1818, in Venice, Italy.",asimov
47,"The gazettes were not then, as now in the American sense of the word, simply newspapers. They were official weekly journals, publishing statistics of governmental interest: movements of the royal family, lists of honors granted, those killed in battle, and so on. Byron refers to the gazettes now and then in |||italics|||Don Juan,|||/italics||| chiefly in order to bestow a sardonic glance at their role as a military obituary list.",asimov
48,"Don Juan is an “ancient friend” because he was a well-known figure out of Spanish folklore. He first received recognized literary presentation in a drama |||italics|||El Burlador de Sevilla|||/italics|||, written in 1630 by the Spanish dramatist Gabriel Téllez (who wrote under the pseudonym Tirso de Molina).
In the original folk tale, Don Juan was the epitome of the licentious man, who aspired (usually successfully) to make love to every woman he met, and who did so with utter disregard for any law. The climax of his story is his liaison with a noblewoman and its consequences. He kills the woman’s father in a duel. The father is buried and an effigy of him is placed over the tomb. Don Juan, seeing that effigy, mockingly invites it to dinner. The stone figure duly arrives at the meal and drags the rake and blasphemer to Hell.
Various versions of this legend had already appeared in Spain and elsewhere by Byron’s time. Molière had written an play on the theme and Mozart, an opera. Byron, with no compunction whatever, utterly alters the plot in his own version. In fact, all that Byron leaves of the traditional Don Juan, is his name and birthplace; |||italics|||nothing more!|||/italics||| Don Juan’s character is utterly changed. From a heartless blasphemer, seducer, and libertine (as the world viewed Byron), he becomes an innocent, far more sinned against than sinning (as Byron viewed himself). Even the hero’s name is tampered with for Byron abandons the universal “Don Wahn” and calls him, with sturdy English disregard for the eccentric pronunciation of foreigners, “Don Joo’un,” as we can tell by the fact that he rhymes Juan with “new one” and “true one.”",asimov
49,"Don Juan was also a favorite in pantomimes and puppet shows, particularly one adapted from the play |||italics|||The Libertine|||/italics||| by Thomas Shadwell. The climax of such shows invariably came at the point where Don Juan, defiant to the last, is dragged down to Hell by the devil to the screaming enthusiasm of the audience.",asimov
50,"Edward Vernon (1684–1757) was an English admiral who wore a grogram cloak (one woven of coarse silk) in bad weather and was consequently called “Old Grog”. He was the first to issue rations of rum and water to the crew. Diluted liquor, and then liquor of any kind, came to be known as “grog” in sailor slang.",asimov
51,"William Augustus (1721–1765), a son of George II of Great Britain and an uncle of George III, was created Duke of Cumberland in 1726. In 1745 he headed the British forces fighting off the last Stuart attempt to regain the throne. On April 16, 1746, he defeated the Scottish adherents of “Bonnie Prince Charlie” at Culloden, then pursued and crushed the fleeing rebels with sufficient cruelty to wipe out Stuart hopes forever and to earn for himself the nickname “the butcher”.",asimov
52,"James Wolfe (1727–1759) was an English general who fought with Cumberland against the Stuarts, but gained his chief fame in North America. In 1759 he led the British forces against Quebec, defeated the French, and, in effect, took Canada. Wolfe, however, was mortally wounded and died at the moment of victory.",asimov
53,"Edward Hawke (1705–1781), an English admiral, reached the peak of his career in 1759, too. In this year Hawke defeated the French fleet off the southern shore of Britany.",asimov
54,"Ferdinand (1721–1792) was the son of Ferdinand Albert II of Brunswick. He fought under Frederick the Great of Prussia in the Seven Years’ War, in which Britain was Frederick’s ally. When Ferdinand beat the French in two land battles in 1758 and 1759, he qualified as a British hero.",asimov
55,"John Manners, Marquis of Granby (1721–1770), was commander in chief of the British forces fighting in Germany in alliance with Frederick the Great during the Seven Years’ War.",asimov
56,"John Burgoyne (1722–1792) is best remembered (particularly in the United States) for the defeat of his army and his surrender at Saratoga, New York, in 1777. This was the turning point of the American Revolution.",asimov
57,"Augustus Keppel (1725–1786) was an English admiral, best known for his failure to defeat the French at sea in 1778 during the American Revolution.",asimov
58,"Sir William Howe (1729–1814) was an English general, best known as the British commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 and his capture of New York in 1776. On the whole, though, and partly because he rather sympathized with the American cause, he failed in his task of crushing the American rebellion and resigned his command in 1778.",asimov
59,"One indication of fame in the England of Byron’s time was the use of the figure of a man or woman as the sign for a public house. In a society which was largely illiterate, signs in the form of images rather than words were useful. Thus, in Charles Dickens’ |||italics|||Pickwick Papers|||/italics|||, Samuel Weller’s mother-in-law (i. e. stepmother) owned a public house known as “Marquis of Granby”",asimov
60,"All of the eighteenth-century generals and admirals listed by Byron in the first two lines of this verse had utterly paled before the glory of Arthur Wellesley. He fought successfully in India, then in Spain against Napoleon’s generals (where, in 1809, he became Viscount Wellington). He fought his way through Spain into France and, after Napoleon’s first abdication, he was made Duke of Wellington. He commanded the British forces in the climactic and victorious battle of Waterloo in 1815.
Wellington was hated by Byron as firmly as Castlereagh and Southey were, since Wellington was as staunch a pillar of reaction in post-Napoleonic Britain and, worse, was idolized by the public. Byron lists only military and political heroes in this verse and those following, perhaps because it was of this group that “a new one” was constantly appearing and then found out as “not the true one”. It is very likely that Byron was pleased at being able to point out the evanescence of military and political glory (as opposed, perhaps, to literary glory) because he hated war and despised the kind of politics then current. It gave him the chance to imply that Wellington in his turn would be soon forgotten. (But, alas for Byron, he wasn’t.)",asimov
61,"In Act IV, scene i of Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Macbeth|||/italics|||, the ghost of Banquo (whom Macbeth had caused to be assassinated) at one point leads a procession of eight future kings of Scotland in order to triumph over his assassin, who is watching in frustration, since the kings are to be Banquo’s descendants and not his own. One by one, in stately fashion, the kings move across the stage.",asimov
62,"Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), or Buonaparte in the Italian spelling, was the most remarkable general of modern times. He dominated France from 1799, becoming emperor in 1804. He defeated all Europe in spectacular victories, then suffered equally spectacular defeats. His final defeat and exile came in 1815 and at the time this canto was written he had been in exile at the lonely island of St. Helena for three years. Byron and indeed a whole generation of Europeans was fascinated by Napoleon’s extraordinary rise and catastrophic fall.",asimov
63,"Charles François Dumouriez (1739–1823) was a French general who won the minor skirmish at Valmy in 1792, an incident that preserved the republic from the first assault of the surrounding monarchies. He was a moderate, however, and the next year deserted to the Austrians before the radicals could have him recalled and executed.",asimov
64,"The |||italics|||Moniteur|||/italics||| and |||italics|||Courier|||/italics||| were French newspapers, the former being the official government spokesman under Napoleon.",asimov
65,"Antoine P. J. M. Barnave (1761–1793) was a French politician who was active in revolutionary affairs, but whose moderation the Revolution outpaced; he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror.",asimov

68,"Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau (1749–1791) was a moderate revolutionary who dominated France during the first two years after the fall of the Bastille and who might possibly have kept France a limited monarchy had he not died of natural causes while still comparatively young.",asimov
69,"Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve (1756–1794) was mayor of Paris from 1791 to 1792 and was moderate enough to be in danger later on. He was imprisoned in 1793 but escaped. Rather than let himself be retaken (when that seemed likely), he killed himself.",asimov
70,"Jean Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, Baron de Cloots (1755–1794), was an ultra-revolutionary, whose extreme views against religion brought him to the guillotine in 1794 for being |||italics|||too|||/italics||| radical. (It was hard to win in those days.)",asimov
71,"George Jaques Danton (1759–1794) was the most colorful of the leaders of the French Revolution. He arranged for the execution of the moderates such as Barnave and the radicals such as Cloots, but in the end went to the guillotine himself.",asimov
72,"Jean Paul Marat (1743–1793) was one of the radical revolutionaries, who consistently denounced all moderates and as consistently advocated violence.

73,"Marie Joseph du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), is best known to Americans as a young and enthusiastic foreign volunteer fighting under Washington.

80,Horatio Nelson (1758–1805) was a British admiral during the wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. He won repeated victories and upheld British pride at a time when her armies were small and achieved no success.,asimov
81,"Nelson wiped out the French fleet in Britain’s greatest naval victory in 1805 at Trafalgar on the Atlantic side of the Strait of Gibraltar. He was killed in this battle but not before he knew he was a victor.

89,"Seville is a town of southern Spain, 240 miles southwest of Madrid. The height of its prosperity came in the twelfth century when it was capital of what was left of Moorish Spain, and again in the sixteenth century when it benefited from the trade that came after the Spanish exploration and conquests in the Americas. Byron visited it in 1809 during his coming-of-age European tour.",asimov

93,"“Don,” from the Latin |||italics|||dominus|||/italics||| (master), was used as a title first by Spanish noblemen, then by anyone who was of the gentry, and finally by anyone who could get away with it (like the English “mister”).",asimov
94,"The word |||italics|||hidalgo|||/italics||| meaning, literally, “son of something” implied that a person was of honorable descent and could therefore use “Don” before his name. Since parts of Spain had been under the domination of Moors for seven centuries, and since during that time, the Jews made up a strong and prosperous minority, in the Moorish portions at least, there had been interbreeding between the native Christian Spaniards and the others. It was a point of honor among the Spanish nobility of later times that no Moors or Jews were to be found in |||italics|||their|||/italics||| ancestry.",asimov
95,"Before the invading Moors conquered Spain in 711, Spain had for three centuries been under the rule of a Gothic tribe called the Visigoths. To be able to trace one’s ancestry beyond the Moorish era to the Visigoths themselves would, of course, be the last word in Spanish nobility.",asimov
96,"Byron, who valued women for parts other than their brains, detested female intellectuals. This feeling of his was strengthened, broadened, deepened, and intensified by the fact that Lady Byron (nee Annabella Milbanke) with whom he had contracted a brief and disastrous marriage, followed by an even more disastrous (for Byron) separation that led to his permanent exile, was a “learned lady.” There seems no question but that Byron’s picture of Don Juan’s mother is intended as a satire on Lady Byron.",asimov
97,Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600–1681) was the greatest Spanish dramatist of his times. To know all of him by heart was quite a feat since he wrote something like two hundred plays.,asimov
98,"Lope de Vega (1562–1635) preceded Calderón and was even more prolific — indeed, one of the most prolific writers of all time for he is supposed to have written over two thousand plays, of which nearly five hundred survive.

103,"In Byron’s time it was customary to leave “damn” unspelled out to avoid trouble with the censor. Obviously, the inclusion of two letters and the necessity of rhyme makes the word unmistakable, but censorship is characteristically concerned with form rather than reason.",asimov
104,"Sir Samuel Romilly (1757–1818) was an English lawyer who was a liberal and a reformer. He sympathized with the French Revolution and labored all his life in the cause of law reform against the blind opposition of the forces of post-Napoleonic reaction.
When his wife died on October 29, 1818, he found life unbearable and committed suicide in distraction on November 2, the day after Byron completed the first canto. Presumably, Byron went back to insert this heartless stanza. He might have sympathized with Sir Samuel for his liberal principles, but he had retained Sir Samuel as his lawyer in the separation proceedings and Sir Samuel had then (with rather shifty ethics) slid over to Lady Byron’s side. Byron could not forgive him this.",asimov

Harrison earned the reward fairly, but Parliament proved monumentally cheap in attempting to deny it to him and finally gave in only at the direct intervention of George III.",asimov
110,"In the early nineteenth century, an oil was imported into England derived from certain trees that grew in the vicinity of Macassar, the capital of the island of Celebs in the East Indies. Because it was from the fabled islands of the Far East, it was considered exotic and it received the hard sell as a specific guarding against baldness, in which respect it was (according to the impartial merchants who were profiting from its sale) “incomparable.”
Macassar oil became so commonly used and heads became so ineffably greasy as a result that special napkins had to be draped on overstuffed chairs and sofas to prevent the drenching of the upholstery. These are the “antimacassars,” a name still used today though the oil has long since gone into deserved oblivion.",asimov

113,"In an unfinished preface to the first to cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||, first published in 1901, Byron asks the reader to suppose that “the following epic Narrative is told by a Spanish Gentleman in a village in the Sierra Morena.” While it is quite clear that Byron, throughout the poem, frequently uses the first person to represent himself, at this point the “I” takes direct part in the action and may be supposed to be the “Spanish Gentleman” who is telling the story. This affectation is quickly dropped.",asimov
114,"In the entire epic there is only one event that can be dated and that is the siege of Izmail in Cantos VII and VIII. This took place in 1790 and if Juan was then eighteen, as he might have been, he would have been born in 1772. However, Byron pays no attention to dates at all, and it is enough to know that the time of the poem is pre-Napoleonic but not much so.",asimov

116,"Among the ancient Greeks, the Spartans most affected stern military virtue. Their warriors were trained to battle from childhood and the Spartan wife ideally expected her husband to return “with his shield or on it.” Since a Spartan could only retreat effectively if he discarded his heavy shield, the phrase called for no retreat — her husband must return victorious with his shield or as a dead body borne on it.",asimov

The two parts were never again separated but the memory of the distinction between them long lingered.",asimov
123,"Classical education, dealing with ancient Latin literature and such Greek literature as survived, had, as its brightest items, three great epics.

The |||italics|||Aeneid|||/italics||| was written some eight centuries or so after the Homeric poems by the Latin poet Publius Vergilius Maro (70–19 B.C.), commonly known as Vergil. It was in direct imitation of Homer and dealt with the wanderings of the Trojan hero Aeneas after the fall of Troy.",asimov
124,"While the epic poets were, for the most part, straitlaced enough, the lyricists and satirists of pre-Christian Greece and Rome took unabashed joy in the pleasures of wine and sex, as Byron (who resembled them in this) loved to point out. Publius Ovidius Naso (43 B.C.–A.D. 17), commonly known as Ovid, wrote a book called |||italics|||The Art of Love|||/italics||| that was so erotic that it led to the poet’s exile by the moralistic Emperor Augustus.",asimov
125,"Anacreon (572–488 B.C.) was a Greek lyric poet, whose short odes celebrated love and wine.",asimov
126,Gaius Valerius Catullus (84–54 B.C.) was the greatest of the Roman lyricists and wrote a series of erotic poems to a woman who apparently did not require his love.,asimov
127,Sappho (about 600 B.C.) was the greatest of the Greek lyric poets. Very little of her work survives but the ancients thought of her as comparable to Homer. Her lyrics to girls causes her to be suspected of homosexuality. It is from the face that she lived on the island of Lesbos that “lesbianism” has come to signify female homosexuality.,asimov
128,"Dionysius Cassius Longinus (213–273) was supposed to have been the author of a treatise, |||italics|||On the Sublime|||/italics|||.

129,"In addition to the |||italics|||Aeneid|||/italics|||, Vergil wrote shorter poems, including a series of pastorals, in several of which Corydon appears ad a lovesick shepherd. In the one that begins |||italics|||“Formosum Pastor Corydon”|||/italics||| (The handsome shepherd, Corydon), Corydon is in love with a beautiful boy. The classic poets had no objection to homosexuality and neither had Byron, who was bisexual. Undoubtedly, Byron took pleasure in calling the attention of his readers to this work.",asimov

His views were considered horribly atheistic in Christian times.",asimov

146,By 1232 the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain had extended their power over almost the whole of the peninsula. Left in Moorish hands was only a small section of southern Spain centered around the city of Granada. This kingdom of Granada maintained itself for two and a half centuries not capitulating to the combined power of Castille and Aragon (see note 122) till 1492.,asimov
147,"Abu-‘Abdullah (called Boabdil by the Spaniards) was the last King of Granada. When defeated in 1492 and forced to cross over into Africa, he paused on a hill outside Granada to look back one last time at the city which had been Moorish for nearly eight centuries. The spot from which he looked back is called “El Último Suspiro del Moro” (The Last Sigh of the Moor), and as he wept, his mother said harshly, “You do well to weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man.”",asimov
148,"One of the terms of the surrender of Granada was that Moors who remained in Spain would be accorded freedom of worship. The Christian zeal of the Spanish priesthood in succeeding decades made the promise a mockery. By 1525 the Moors were forced either to convert or to leave. Even the converted Moors remained suspect, however, and were constantly hounded under the suspicion of being secretly Mohammedan and in league with the African states south of the Mediterranean.
Finally, in 1609, they were forced out of Spain and the country lost nearly a million of its most industrious and capable citizens, serving thus its own ruin. By then, however, there had been numerous intermarriages and many Spaniards could find traces of Moorish ancestry — if they looked.",asimov
149,"There was a great deal of cousin-marriage in Byron’s family. But that was not all. Perhaps the most scandalous item in the Byronic array of scandal was the fact that Byron seems to have made his half sister, Augusta, his mistress, and to have had a daughter by her. He was fascinated by his own action in this respect and dealt with incest over and over in his writing. He enjoys hinting at it here, no doubt.",asimov

151,"St. Anthony (250–355) was the first Christian monk and the first to practice extreme asceticism. Fleeing to the solitude of the desert in order to escape the temptations of the world, he nevertheless found himself tempted by the devil. Many legends clustered about his memory concerning the manner of those temptations and the heroic measures taken by Anthony to counteract them. However, snow in the Egyptian desert, where Anthony resided, is hard to come by, and actually it was St. Francis who used the cold of ice to overcome the heat of lust, something Byron refers to later in the poem (see note 628).",asimov
152,"Was Byron thinking of his vicious nurse, May Gray (see note 140)? If so, those real life caresses were by no means “innocently done” and in view of Byron’s later sexual problems could scarcely have been “harmless.”",asimov
153,"When Byron was sixteen, he was very much in love with Mary Chaworth who was then nineteen. Nothing ever came of it for, as Miss Chaworth told her maid, “Do you think I could care anything for that lame boy?” Byron may have overheard and his sensitivity over his lameness made this cold rebuff all the worse. Juan’s success as a sixteen-year-old certainly makes up in the poem for Byron’s failure as a sixteen-year-old in reality.
A number of Byron’s love affairs, by the way, were with women older than himself. Lady Oxford, or instance, who was his mistress in 1812, was sixteen years older than he.",asimov

Tarquinus Sextus raped a chaste Roman matron, Lucretia, who killed herself out of shame, in consequence.

She fell instantly and helplessly in love with Jason the Argonaut, when he came adventuring to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece. She helped him gain it from her own father and then fled with him, killing her younger brother on the way. When Jason tired of her in favor of a younger woman, she killed her own children by him in order to punish him.

163,"March is the rutting season for hares when, driven by sexual passion, they are at once unusually bold and unusually erratic. Comparing their behavior in March with that in other months, men find them mad so that “mad as a March hare” has become a common phrase. Byron implies that the end of spring is a kind of rutting season for women.",asimov
164,"A houri was a nymph who was imagined by Moslems to exist in Heaven for the delectation of the faithful. Houris were ever-beautiful and ever-willing, yet managed to be ever-virginal as well and (if they desired) ever-fruitful. No mention is made of intelligence.",asimov

167,A louis was a gold coin first issued by Louis XII of France in 1640 and was the rough equivalent of the English pound. The French revolutionaries no longer coined it after 1795.,asimov
168,"Xerxes I (519–465 B.C.) was the King of Persia who led an enormous army into Greece and was defeated at the battle of Salamis (see note 371) in 480 B.C.
After the battle, he retired to his capital and to his harem, and there he stayd for the remainder of his reign, leaving the war to his regional governors and his generals.
The power and luxury of a monarch of the giant Persian empire was enormous and seemed all the greater to the inhabitants of the small Greek city-states, since their own accumulations of wealth were, of necessity, much smaller. Xerxes therefore became the personification of the luxurious pleasure seeker.",asimov
169,"Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) was the most famous of the Greek philosophers (except perhaps for his teacher, Plato). From those parts of his writings on drama that have survived, men have gleaned Aristotle’s thinking on its rules: that tragedies were concerned with kings and famous men and comedies, with common folk.
He also believed in the tightness of plotting, in the “unities.” He felt a play had to have unity of action — a single plot with no incident that did not contribute to its advancement. It must also have a unity of time and of place — the action must take place within twenty-four hours and in a single setting.
Needless to say, Aristotle’s rules are by no means essential to great drama; Shakespeare broke them all in almost every play. Byron’s pretended adherence to them here is meant ironically, for |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is as un-Aristotelian in this respect as it is possible to be.",asimov
170,"Adria is an ancient town in northern Italy, near the Po delta. It was founded by the Etruscans while Rome was as yet a village. It was originally on the Adriatic Sea, which was named for it, and was its most important port. With the silting up of the harbor by the Po River, this aspect of its existence vanished. The city is now thirteen miles inland. The name can be applied, poetically, to Venice, founded at least a thousand years after Adria was, and some twenty-five miles to its north. Byron was living in Venice while he wrote these lines, and while there he surely could not help but hear the gondoliers, who traditionally sing as they row.",asimov
171,"“Bacchanal” is an adjective derived from Bacchus, the Greek god of wine.",asimov
172,"While in exile, Byron looked forward with considerable anticipation to the death of his mother-in-law, Lady Judith Milbanke, from whom he expected to inherit a considerable legacy. She did finally die in 1822 (four years after these lines were written) at the age of seventy-one. Byron inherited an income of £3,000 a year — a fortune in the Italy of those days. Lady Judith’s maiden name was Noel, and Byron added that to his own name in order to qualify for the inheritance, becoming George Gordon Noel Byron.",asimov
173,"“Us youth” is the famous cry of Falstaff in Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Henry IV, Part One|||/italics||| who, aged and fat, nevertheless retained a relish for the vices associated with youthful roguery. Thus, when Falstaff and some of his cronies hold up and rob a group of merchants, Falstaff places himself on the youthful side of the generation gap, crying out against the victims and in defense of his own actions: “They hate us youth” (II, ii, 85).",asimov
174,"Byron was markedly anti-Semitic, which shows up in various places in |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| and which represents a flaw in his liberal views. His anti-Semitism, however, was specialized and directed against moneylenders. While young men of good family were denied the money held by the older members of that same family, they could borrow money on their expectations, with the promise of repaying principle, plus a healthy interest, after the old have died and the money has been inherited. Such a deal is a “post-obit,” short for |||italics|||post obitum|||/italics||| which is Latin for “after death.” Byron began borrowing in college, was thousands of pounds in debt before he was twenty-one, and stayed in debt almost all his life.
Naturally, the moneylenders were at the door immediately upon news of the ancient’s death, since it would not take long for the inheritor to squander their money or to make way abroad without paying. Most of the young men involved, Byron included, saw no harm in trying to avoid repaying the money they had borrowed, whether to moneylenders or to tradesmen. It was the aristocratic thing to do, for we must remember that the aristocratic sense of honor was a specialized thing, usually granted only to other aristocrats and that parsimoniously. The inheritors naturally scorned and even hated the mercenary wretches who were so greedy as to want their own money back (plus the high interest made necessary by the playful aristocratic habit of defaulting). Since many of the English moneylenders of the period were Jews, it was on their heads that resentment such as Byron’s particularly fell.",asimov
175,It is sometimes maintained (and Byron apparently does so here) that the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge symbolized the discovery by Adam and Eve of the sexual act.,asimov
176,"Prometheus, in the Greek myths, was a Titan who, having created the human race, took pity on its miserable state, since Zeus denied it the necessary knowledge for elementary comfort. Prometheus therefore stole fire from the sun and gave it to mankind. The angered Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to Mount Caucasus in what was, to the Greeks, the Far East, and arranging to have an eagle (or vulture) gnaw ceaselessly at his liver.",asimov
177,"Byron’s dilettantish interest in scientific advance shows up in several places in |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||, as here, for instance. The “new noses” is not a reference to plastic surgery, but to some quack remedy highly touted in Byron’s time for curing everything right down to red noses.",asimov
178,"The use of the guillotine was first proposed in 1789 by a French physician, Joseph Ignace Guillotin (1738–1814), after whom it was named. Actually, it was a humane device producing instant and presumably painless death, in place of the executioner’s ax, which sometimes missed, with horrible results.",asimov
179,"Sir William Congreve (1772–1828) introduced the use of rocket artillery to the west. It was used by the British armed forces in the War of 1812 against the United States, specifically in the bombarding of Fort McHenry in Baltimore. It was on this occasion that Francis Scott Key (1779–1843) wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner” which includes the phrase “the rockets’ red glare.” Rockets were also used in 1813 at the battle of Leipzig where Napoleon was defeated. Rockets were soon overtaken by improvements in conventional artillery and dropped out of use, only to return in World War II.",asimov
180,"The English physician Edward Jenner (1749–1823) observed that those who contracted the disease known as cowpox (or, in Latin, |||italics|||vaccinia|||/italics||| from |||italics|||vacca|||/italics||| meaning “cow”) were not only immune to attacks of cowpox thereafter but seemed to be immune to the much more serious disease of smallpox as well. In 1796, therefore, he performed the experiment of deliberately injecting a young boy with fluid from a cowpox blister. This gave the boy cowpox. When he recovered, he was inoculated with fluid from a smallpox blister — and nothing happened. The process of protecting against smallpox by the use of cowpox is “vaccination.”",asimov
181,"In 1771 an Italian anatomist, Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) noted that an electric shock would cause dead muscles to contract, an effect called “galvanism” in his honor. This roused great interest since it seemed to imply there was a life principle in electricity and offered the hope that somehow life might be restored to a dead body. Indeed, in 1803 Galvani’s nephew Giovanni Aldini (1762–1834) experimented with the use of electric shocks on the body of a hanged murderer.
In 1816 Byron, after having left England, but before he came to Italy, had spent time on the shores of Lake Geneva, with Persey Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), Shelley’s mistress, Mary Godwin (1792–1851), and some others. They talked about galvanism one night and all agreed to write what we would today call science fiction stories. Only Mary Godwin (who married Shelley shortly after) came through. She wrote the famous |||italics|||Frankenstein,|||/italics||||||italics||| published in 1818.|||/italics|||",asimov
182,"The Royal Humane Society, founded in 1758, taught methods of artificial respiration for those who seemed drowned, with the result that not a few were saved. Artificial respiration was thus more effective in restoring life (though, to be sure, the former worked only when life had not yet departed in the first place).",asimov
183,"The “great pox” is syphilis, a disease which, in the days of vaccination, Byron had more cause to fear than smallpox.",asimov
184,"There is reference to syphilis by European writers before the time of Columbus, but the first real epidemic of the disease was only reported after Columbus’s return from America. This, combined with the fact that evidence of syphilis has been found in the bones of pre-Columbian indians, has led to the theory that Columbus’s sailors picked up syphilis from Indian women and brought it back to Europe. (On the other hand, it may be that there was merely a change of names; that what Europeans called syphilis in modern times, they had called “leprosy” in the Middle Ages.)",asimov
185,"The English economist Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834) wrote an epoch-making book |||italics|||An Essay on the Principle of Population|||/italics||| in 1798 and was the first to point out the danger of overpopulation and the necessity of lowering the birth rate. Byron was fascinated by this and refers to the matter several times in |||italics|||Don Juan.|||/italics||| (The Industrial Revolution postponed the Malthusian nemesis and allowed a quadrupling of the world’s population since 1800 — so that the danger, when it returned in the mid-twentieth century, is now worse than ever.)",asimov

187,"In the mining coal there was sometimes an accumulation of inflammable methane gas. The use of open candle flames to guide miners in the dark depths was an invitation to sometimes disastrous explosions. In 1815 the English chemist Sir Hamphrey Davy (1778–1829), a friend of Byron’s, devised a system for enclosing the candle flame in wire gauze. The metal radiated heat quickly so that beyond it the ignition temperature was not reached. This “Davy lamp” was an enormous contribution to mine safety.",asimov
188,"Tombouctou (the official spelling fot the town most often known in English as Timbuktu) is located in what is now the nation of Mali, along the middle reaches of the Niger River. It was once a center for caravan routes across the Sahara and about 1500 was the capital of the Songhoi empire, a black realm. In 1590 the Songhoi empire was destroyed by Moroccan forces who used firearms, but its distant memory held an exotic fascination for Europeans. In Byron’s time, Europeans were just beginning to explore the African interior, and word of Tombouctou appeared, for instance, in a book entitled |||italics|||An Account of the Empire of Morocco|||/italics||| by James Grey Jackson, published 1809. The city was not actually reached, however, till 1826 (eight years after these lines were written), when the Scottish explorer Alexander Gordon Laing (1793–1826) arrived there and was promptly killed by Arab traders.",asimov
189,"As soon as it was understood that the earth was a rotating sphere, it was also understood that it had to possess a North Pole and a South Pole. Reaching either across wildernesses of snow and ice was a problem, however. Explorers slowly worked their way further and further northward and southward and in Byron’s time were only five hundred miles short of the North Pole and eleven hundred miles short of the south. These explorations were brought to public attention by books on polar exploration written by Sir John Ross (1777–1856), published in 1819, and by Sir William Edward Parry (1790–1855), published in 1820, not long after the first part of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| was published. The poles themselves, however, were not reached for nearly a century after Byron’s time.",asimov
190,"The battle of Waterloo, fought on June 18, 1815, was, in Byron’s time, and for a century after, a kind of military watershed. It was the battle at which Napoleon’s power had been broken once and for all, and the battle at which Great Britain’s military prestige reached its all-time high point. Byron viewed Waterloo as a defeat, however, for by it the reactionary monarchs of Europe were enabled to turn the clock back and erase the advances toward freedom begun by the French Revolution.",asimov
191,"A |||italics|||cortejo|||/italics||| is, literally, a suitor, but it is generally used to represent the recognized lover of a lady, one who has the tacit approval of the husband, but who carefully maintains the appearance of respectability.",asimov
192,"Most of the individuals mentioned by Donna Julia in this passage are fictitious, but the Irish soldier Alexander O’Reilly (1722–1794) was a lieutenant general in the Spanish army. In 1768 he put down a revolt in the Louisiana Territory with considerable cruelty.",asimov
193,"O’Reilly never took Algiers, however. He assaulted the city in 1775 but was driven back with the loss of four thousand men. It was not till 1830, a dozen years after these lines were written, that Algiers was taken. Then it was by French forces who thus established the beginning of the French African empire that was to last for a century and a quarter.",asimov
194,"There was indeed a Count Giambattista Corniani (1742–1813) of this period, but he was a harmless historian of Italian literature and is surely not referred to here. Probably the name is used as a play on |||italics|||cornuto,|||/italics||| the Italian word for “cuckold.” The name, Cazzani, two lines before may be a play on the Italian vilgarism |||italics|||cazzo|||/italics|||, meaning “penis.”",asimov

199,"George, Duke of Clarence (1449–1478), was a younger brother of King Edward IV of England. He was accused of secretly plotting against the King’s life, was convicted, and was imprisoned in the Tower. There he was secretly executed. A legend arose later to the effect that he was drowned in a butt of malmsey (that is, in a barrel of a variety of sweet wine produced from malvasia grapes).

His servants said to him: “Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin:and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat” (I Kings 1:2). David lived, as Byron says, but not for very long, for he dies in the next chapter.",asimov
201,"In 1240 Europe was invaded by the Mongols, or Tatars. Of all the barbarian invasions from the east, this was the most rapid and the most deadly. The Tatars eventually retreated, but only because the death of their king made it necessary to be on hand to elect a new one. They never returned, but Europeans received a scare they never forgot. The word “Tatar” was converted to “Tartar,” for the invaders seemed so irresistible and evil as to be demons from Tartarus, the section of Hades reserved for the torture of evil-doers in the Greek myths. The word “tartar” came to be applied to any person capable of doing great harm in his fits of anger.",asimov

A visit to Hell would therefore be a natural part of the hero’s adventures in any epic. Since Byron maintains that |||italics|||Don Juan |||/italics|||is an epic and since Don Juan in the original tale goes to Hell at the end, he promises such a scene. However, the promise never came to pass (too bad!) partly because Byron never really finished the poem and partly because Byron’s aims shifted.",asimov

209,"John Dryden (1631–1700) was an English poet who, like Byron, wrote satiric epics, notably |||italics|||Absalom and Achiophel|||/italics||| in 1681 and |||italics|||The Hind and Panther|||/italics||| in 1687. Byron may have liked the poetry, but it is odd that he did not take notice of the fact that, unlike Milton (see note 31), Dryden was an apostate. He turned from his Puritan background to Catholicism.",asimov
210,"Alexander Pope (1688–1744) was an English poet, undersized and deformed (but with giant wit and intelligence), who wrote mock-heroic epics such as |||italics|||The Rape of the Lock |||/italics|||in 1712. He wrote almost entirely in couplets and was, of all English poets, the only one who may have been Byron’s superior in the savagery of his wit. Byron admired Pope more than any other poet and Byron’s first satire |||italics|||English Bards and Scotch Reviewers|||/italics||| (1809) was a deliberate, and effective, piece of writing in the style of Pope. (Other poets mentioned in this stanza were dealt with in the Dedication.)",asimov
211,William Sotheby was a minor literary figure whom Byron disliked. He believed Sotheby to have been the author of an anonymous and unfavorable review condemning Byron’s |||italics|||Prisoner of Chillon|||/italics|||.

Thus, either twelve or twenty-four seemed natural in an epic. Here, Byron is thinking of twelve, with the twelfth and last reserved for the climactic scene in Hell.

214,"The |||italics|||British Review|||/italics||| was, of course, not really bribed; this was just Byron’s idea of a joke. (His sense of fun sometimes overstepped the bounds of what most people would consider good taste.) The shocked and humorless editor of the periodical protested his innocence vigorously, but no doubt that just added to the fun.",asimov
215,"In 1802 the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review|||/italics||| was founded and issued in a buff-and-blue cover indicating its sympathies with the Whig Party. Its reviewers pulled no punches and when they disliked something, often enjoyed showing their own brilliance at the expense of the one they were pillorying (an occupational disease of critics which coses them uncounted friends). In 1807, when Byron was only nineteen, he published his first volume of poetry, |||italics|||Hours of Idleness|||/italics|||, and this was instantly seized upon by the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review,|||/italics||| which treated its author “very martyrly” indeed.
The review, published anonymously in the January 1808 issue, was by Henry Peter Brougham (see note 942), one of the founders of the journal, and Byron never forgave him once he discovered the identity of the author.

It was just as apt to overkill its targets as the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review|||/italics||| was.",asimov
217,"This passage from Horace means “I would not have borne this in my flaming youth while Plancus was consul.” Plancus was Lucius Munatius Plancus, who was consul in 42 B.C. when Horace was twenty-three years old. Byron indicates that this means that he himself would have been a lot readier to resent a hostile review six or seven years earlier when he was twenty-three. And so he was (see note 215), but the implication that he had attained to the coolness of age now that he was thirty was an exaggerated one — his resentment of adverse criticism and his habit of returning the blow with all his might never cooled.",asimov
218,"The Brenta River in northeastern Italy flows into the Adriatic Sea about twenty miles south of Venice. Byron was an inveterate, and brilliant, letter writer, and these letters he was now “dating” from his exile at a summer villa, seven miles inland on the left bank of Brenta.",asimov
219,"Byron’s “flaming youth” of twenty-three (by Horatian standards) was in 1811, when George III was still king. It was in that year that George’s madness became so unmistakable that he was declared unfit to rule and the actual power turned over to his son as Regent. Of course, the old madman was still alive when Byron wrote these line and was to live (and theoretically be king) for some two more years.",asimov

221,"Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was an English scholar who was ahead of his time. He believed in experimentation, could make gunpowder and spectacles, dabbled in alchemy, and was greatly feared as a wizard. Tales were told of him in the aftertime that grew better in the telling. One of these is found in |||italics|||Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay|||/italics|||, the chief work of the English dramatist Robert Greene (1560–1592).
This take deals with a brazen head that Bacon had devised, one that could speak and, presumably, tell hidden things. Bacon watched for the head to speak, but sleep overcame him. While he slept, the head spoke. It said “Time is,” then half an hour later, “Time was,” and then, after yet another half hour, said “Time is past” and shattered. Only then, too late, did Bacon awake.
The tale symbolizes the fleeting of time and the lost opportunities that plague all men. Byron uses it to sigh over his lost youth (“chymic” means “alchemic” here with a back-reference to Bacon), so much of it gone in dissipation and folly, and seems to have a presentiment of his early death.",asimov
222,"The ancient Egyptian pyramids were built in order to preserve the ruler’s mummy and the artifacts buried with it so that all (and the nation it represented) might exist in afterlife.

There he met the young Cleopatra and had a son by her.",asimov

Homer referred to it as “the Elysian Plain” (from which we call it, sometimes, “Elysium”) and located it somewhere in the west, for in his time the western Mediterranean was shrouded in mystery and was therefore a suitable place for wonders. It was the later poet Hesiod, who, in the eighth century B.C., referred to the Elysian Plain as the “Islands of the Blest.” By his time, Greek ships were exploring the coasts of the western Mediterranean and Hesiod was forced to place the Islands beyond the westernmost edge of the sea and out into Atlantic Ocean itself.

In 480 B.C. a large army, much larger than the force that had landed at Marathon, crossed the Hellespont into northern Greece and drove southward. Athens had to be abandoned and its citizens manned the fleet that prepared to fight the Persians while the women and children were taken to Salamis under the shadow of that fleet.
Xerxes, the Persian king (see note 168), was with his forces. He sat on an Attica height to overlook the sea fight at which he confidently expected his navy to crush the Greeks. What he saw instead was a decisive Greek sea victory that destroyed his fleet and forced him to return to Persia.",asimov
372,"On the Persian march southward in 480, the march which ended at Salamis, they came to a narrow pass called Thermopylae, protected by a much smaller force of Greeks, led by the Spartan king, Leonidas. In the narrow pass, the Persian numbers could not be used effectively, and the Greeks held out for days. Finally, through the treason of a Greek, the Persians discovered a rocky path that could outflank the pass. The greeks were forced to retreat, but retreat was against the Spartan code, and among those who stayed were Leonidas and his contingent of 300 Spartans. These refused to surrender and fought to the end, dying to the last man, and in their death creating so heroic a legend that the effect on Greek morale was greater than any ordinary victory would have been.",asimov
383,"The Franks, as we have noted (see note 353), were the West Europeans, and Byron sneers at their willingness to help. And yet in this case he was wrong. Byron did not live to see it, but on October 20, 1827, the decisive battle of the Greek War of Independence was fought. It was the naval battle of Navarino, fought on the western coast of the Peloponnesus. In that battle, the Turkish-Egyptian fleet was virtually annihilated by the combined ships of the British, French, and Russian navies. After that, Greek independence was assured.",asimov
389,"John Churchill, first Duke of Marlborough (1650–1722) was a great English general who never really lost a battle and who defeated the armies of King Louis XIV of France during the War of the Spanish Succession. His victory at Blenheim in 1704 was the most notable British military feat during the four-century span between Agincourt (1415) and Waterloo (1815).",asimov
406,"Lodovico Ariosto (1474–1533) was an Italian poet whose best-known work was the epic poem |||italics|||Orlando Furioso,|||/italics||| written in the style of the medieval knightly legends. It was a poem in, ultimately, forty-six cantos and took the poet the final thirty years of his life to write. In 1817 Byron visited Ariosto’s tomb in Ferrara.",asimov
437,"Thetis was the mother of Achilles in Greek mythology. When Achilles was born (her only child), she foresaw that he was destined to have a short life. Attempting to avert this she dipped him in the waters of the Styx (see note 290). This gave his skin invulnerability to all weapons. Unfortunately, she held him by the heel and forgot that the water did not cover the part she held. Achilles’ heel remained vulnerable (hence the meaning of the phrase) and he was eventually killed by an arrow there. Byron feels, ruefully, that forgetfulness is a better guard against the woes of the world than physical invulnerability.",asimov
440,"Pulci’s epic, like Ariosto’s (see note 406), dealt with Orlando, the greatest hero of the medieval hero tales. He is better known to English-speakers as Roland. In history, he was one of Charlemagne’s paladins who died in an ambush in the Pyrenees together with the rearguard that he led. It was a small skirmish but was turned by legend into a major battle. Instead of the Christian Basques who had ambushed and killed Orlando, the villains became Moors, and all kinds of flummery was added, including, “true knights, chaste dames, huge giant kings despotic,” and evil enchanters, too.
In 1605 Cervantes published the first part of |||italics|||Don Quixote|||/italics||| (see note 236), which was intended as a satire on this kind of medieval tale. Don Quixote was a poor madman of high ideals who took the tales of chivalry as literal truth and tried to live the life of one of the story-book knights, hence the word “quixotic,” meaning any action based on irrational idealism. |||italics|||Don Quixote|||/italics||| turned out to be the greatest satire ever written. Not only is it by general consent a complete masterpiece as a work of literature but it did what satires hardly ever do — it killed the thing it satirized. The medieval tale of chivalry did not survive |||italics|||Don Quixote.|||/italics|||",asimov
461,"Ilion is one of the alternate names of Troy. The city was, according to legend, founded by Ilus, the son of Tros. The son and the father are the sources of the two alternate names. Though Troy is the better known name, the |||italics|||Iliad|||/italics||| receives its name from the other.
The ship carrying the wounded Juan was thus traveling northward through the Aegean, for the site of Troy is about 180 miles northeast of the Cyclades.",asimov
463,"In ancient times, there were structures on the Trojan plain that were considered to be the tombs of various notables who had died in the great siege. One was thought to be Achilles’, the greatest of the Greek heroes in Homer’s epic. When Alexander the Great crossed the Dardanelles to begin his invasion of Persia, he first landed at the site of Troy and sacrificed at what was considered the tomb of Priam to avert the vengeance of the Trojan shades and then placed a garland at the tomb of Achilles, whom he always considered his model.",asimov
465,"Patroclus was the best friend of Achilles and, everyone assumes, in view of later Greek customs, his homosexual lover as well, though Homer never says anything of the sort directly. The gentlest and most attractive of the Greek heroes, Patroclus was killed by Hector when he went to war in place of the sulking Achilles. It was his death that forced Achilles into war again.
A tomb near Achilles’ was thought to be that of Patroclus in ancient times. When Alexander placed his garland on Achilles’ tomb (see note 463), Hephaestion, his friend and, presumably, homosexual lover, placed a similar garland on that of Patroclus.",asimov
466,"Ajax was, next to Achilles, the strongest of the Greek heroes. He was never so much as wounded in the |||italics|||Iliad|||/italics||| but his fate was tragic, nevertheless, and he never left Troy. After Achilles died, his armor was granted to Odysseus (Ulysses) for his cleverness rather than to Ajax for his strength. This was justly done, as it was Odysseus’ wiles that, in the end, destroyed Troy, and not the strength of anyone. Sheer disappointment, however, drove Ajax mad, and he killed himself.",asimov
471,"Paris was the son of Priam and Hecuba of Troy. When he was born, Hecuba dreamed she had been delivered of a firebrand that would burn the city. It was therefore decided to expose the newborn infant on Mount Ida and leave him to die. He was, however, found and reared by a shepherd. He spent his youth, therefore, as a shepherd on Mount Ida, until his identity was discovered and he was restored to his true place as a Trojan prince (to end by being the firebrand that destroyed his city). He was noted for his beauty and in that, presumably, the shepherds Byron saw were unlike him.",asimov
475,"Niccolò Machiavelli (1469–1527) was an Italian statesman and political scientist who in his book |||italics|||The Prince|||/italics||| wrote what he thought should be the guiding principles of those who wished to rule. The principles he devised according to practical, and not idealistic, notions; treachery and artifice were recommended as methods for maintaining power, not because such things were admirable but because they worked. The justification was that a stable government was a great good and well repaid a little roguery. A sternly moralistic idealist, who was unable to hold power and who delivered his nation over to the agonies of partisan quarreling and civil war, did no one any favors. As a result of all this, “Machiavellian” has come to mean “treacherous” or “dissimulating.”",asimov
539,"Alexander Vasilievich Suvorov (1729–1800) is usually considered the greatest of all Russian generals; certainly he is the most colorful. The spelling “Suwarrow” is German, where the “w” is pronounced like the English “v”. Taken into the English literature, the German version, unchanged, comes to be rhymed with “sparrow” and that suits Byron, for it is easier to rhyme “Suwarrow” pronounced English fashion than “Suvorov” pronounced in any fashion.",asimov
540,"Suvorov led Russian armies against the Turks from 1773 to 1774, and again from 1787 to 1792. During the latter war, he attempted to take Belgrade and to detach Serbia (the southern part of what now is Yugoslavia) from the Ottoman Empire. In 1789, however, he was repulsed from Widdin (or Vidin), a town on the right bank of the Danube in what is now at the northwest corner of Bulgaria.",asimov
543,"“Voltaire” was the pen name of the French writer François Marie Arouet (1694–1778), the cleverest satirist of his age or, perhaps, of any.",asimov
559,"Babylon reached the peak of its glory about seven centuries after the fabled Nimrod. In the sixth century B.C. it was under the rule of Nabukudurri-user, a name more familiar in the Hebrew version, Nebuchadrezzar, and still better in the misspelling found in the Book of Daniel, Nebuchadnezzar. The Greek translations of the Bible give the name (worse and worse) as Nebuchadonosor, and that is the version Byron uses in order to keep the rhythm of the line smooth.
Nebuchadrezzar reigned from 605 to 562 B.C and under him Babylon was the largest, wealthiest, and most powerful city on earth. One of his devices for beautifying the city was to cover tall mounds with earth, and plant them with trees and shrubs to create what came to be known as the “Hanging Gardens of Babylon.” These were listed by the later Greeks as among the Seven Wonders of the World.",asimov
561,"The Bible tells us that Darius of Persia was forced to throw Daniel into a den of lions as punishment for having prayed to God against the king’s commandments. He was, however, saved from the beasts through divine intervention (Daniel 6:4–23).",asimov
566,"In 323 B.C. Alexander the Great died in Babylon and in 312 B.C. Seleucus Nicator founded the Seleucid empire there. These were the last events of note in the great city. Seleucus founded Seleucia near Babylon as a new capital; and as the new city rose, the old city fell. By A.D. 100 Babylon was a rubbishy village and thereafter it disappeared altogether so that men were left to argue as to the exact site.",asimov
581,"Mary Stuart (1542–1587) inherited the crown of Scotland when she was a week old. She went to France, as a child, married the French king’s oldest son when she was sixteen and, a year later, when the king died, she became Queen of France. One more year, however, and her sickly husband, Francis II, died, and Mary returned to Scotland. She was Catholic but the Scottish nobility was to a large extent Protestant and she had increasing troubles with them.
Mary was renowned for her beauty and her love affairs, but she was a poor politician and in 1568 had to flee to England. Because she had claims to the English throne and was the center of treasonable conspiracies, the English queen, Elizabeth I, imprisoned her for nineteen years and finally had her executed. Throughout her long imprisonment, many were devoted to her, in part for her beauty, or her reputation for beauty. Her tragic story has heightened that reputation with the years. She was forty-five when she died, but the faith in her continued beauty has never failed among the romantics of later generations who could not go back through time to look.",asimov
621,"The Cato referred to here is Marcus Porcius Cato (95–46 B.C.), usually known as Cato the Younger, and the great-grandson of Marcus Porcius Cato (234–149 B.C.), or Cato the Elder. Cato the Younger was a stern stoic of rigid morality but narrow conservatism. He opposed Julius Caesar and died a suicide when Caesar’s victories made the conservative cause hopeless. His stoic superiority to emotion made it possible for him to release his wife, Marcia, when his friend Hortensius fell in love with her. After Hortensius died in 50 B.C., Cato took his wife back. There were not want of cynics, however, who pointed out that Marcia was left a rich legatee when the wealthy Hortensius died and that Cato gave his friend a poor woman and received back a rich one. If virtue always paid in this manner, vice might go out of fashion.",asimov
628,"St. Francis of Assisi (1181–1226) was the most ardent and saintly of all those who tried to follow the teachings of Jesus literally. He founded the Franciscans, an order of mendicant friars who took the vow of poverty. St. Francis himself embraced poverty with the ardor of a groom. He called her “My Lady Poverty” and it is to her that Byron refers here as “St. Francis’ paramour.” There was also a legend that he kept seven great balls of snow near his cell and referred to the largest as his wife. Apparently he had to embrace the snow to quell occasional sexual pressures. In the first canto Byron had mistakenly attributed this to St. Anthony (see note 151).",asimov
633,"The Book of Common Prayer was prepared in 1549 at the time of the English Reformation by Thomas Cranmer, Archbishop of Canterbury. It contains the liturgy used by the Church of England and, of course, basic to it is the Nicene Creed with the curse on unbelievers.",asimov
638,"Patagonia is the southernmost thousand-mile stretch of South America, narrowing to Cape Horn. The first Europeans to see it were Ferdinand Magellan and his crew in 1520.

649,"The tale of Pygmalion is told in Ovid’s |||italics|||Metamorphoses.|||/italics||| Pygmalion was a sculptor who produced a statue so beautiful he fell in love with it. He prayed to Venus, who brought the statue to life for him.",asimov
658,"The earliest meaning of “meteor” is “an atmospheric phenomenon,” the word coming from a Greek term meaning “high in the air.” In modern times, the term has been applied to one particular high-in-the-air phenomenon, the shooting star — a piece of matter from outer space which collides with earth’s atmosphere and, in its rapid passage, is raised to bright incandescence by friction.
This is now the only meaning of the word in the popular mind and the modern meteor is not particularly associated with the North Pole. However, in Byron’s time scientists were just beginning to admit that the tales of stones that fell from heaven were, after all, true, and Byron is still using the word in its older sense. He is referring to the northern lights which are indeed bred in the neighborhood of the magnetic poles, which are near the geographical ones.",asimov
669,"Catherine II (1729–1796) became Empress of Russia in 1762 and, with the possible exception of Peter I (1672–1725), was the land’s greatest sovereign.

By the end of her reign, the northern shores of that sea were Russian and have remained so since.",asimov

685,"Byron proceeds to defend himself against those who denounced |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| for its cynicism by pointing out the long and respected history of satire. Humanity, after all, has been denounced or ridiculed for its faults by many renowned authors, philosophers, and theologians.

688,"Jonathan Swift, the Dublin-born English writer best known for |||italics|||Gulliver’s Travels|||/italics||| (see note 639), was one of the most savagely effective satirists in history. In his |||italics|||Modest Proposal|||/italics||| he suggested that Irish poverty be relieved by having Irish parents fatten their children and sell them as food. So straight-faced was he in this proposal that there were not wanting fools who thought he was seriously advocating cannibalism.

690,"François de La Rochefoucauld (1613–1680) was a French writer who intrigued against both Cardinal Richelieu and Jules Mazarin (two powerful political figures under Louis XIII and Louis XIV, respectively) and yet, wonder of wonders, survived each. He is best known for his |||italics|||Maxims,|||/italics||| first published anonymously in 1665, in which he expressed his cynical views of mankind in the most compressed possible way. Thus: “We give nothing more generously than advice” and “We all have strength enough to endure the misfortunes of another.”",asimov

698,"Diogenes (412–323 B.C.) was a Greek philosopher who is the best-known example of the philosophic school known as “Cynicism.” He believed in the most simple possible life, in abandoning all social conventions as artificial and hypocritical. His standard of absolute honesty and poverty is almost impossible to follow.",asimov
699,"Socrates (470–399 B.C.) was an Athenian philosopher who was judged by the Delphic oracle to be the wisest of all men. When told of this, Socrates answered wryly, “If I am the wisest of all men, surely it is because I, alone of all men, know that I know nothing.”
This is not to be taken as meaning that nothing can be known — as Byron ironically takes it in the next lines. What Socrates meant was that he did not accept anything without question; that he subjected everything he |||italics|||seemed|||/italics||| to know to serious inquiry on the assumption that he might not really know what he thought he knew.",asimov
700,"Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was the English mathematician and scientist who deduced the binomial theorem, discovered calculus, invented the reflecting telescope, founded the science of optics, and worked out the law of universal gravitation —all of this making him, by common consent and beyond argument, the greatest scientist who ever lived. He had many faults but among his virtues was an engaging modesty. He said, “I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.”",asimov

702,"Byron, proudly refusing to moderate the force of his satire, here deliberately misquotes a passage from the Introduction to |||italics|||The Faerie Queen|||/italics||| by Edmund Spencer (1552–1599). The passage should properly read, “Fierce wars and faithful loves shall moralize my song.” Byron had read parts of |||italics|||Faerie Queen|||/italics||| during his Mediterranean tour and had been sufficiently impressed to decide to write |||italics|||Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage|||/italics||| in Spenserian stanzas.",asimov
703,"We are back to Suvorov (see note 539). “Souvaroff” is the French spelling and “Suwarrow” the German (|||italics|||not |||/italics|||English or “Anglice”). Byron uses both spellings in this canto and the next, according to the exigencies of rhyme and meter.",asimov
704,"Suvorov’s love for blood is more a love of victory, and victories he gained. In the last year of his life he was even able to defeat the French armies in Italy, despite the disadvantage of having the Austrians as allies. (To be sure, the French armies were not, at this time, led by Napoleon.)
However, since Russian soldiers, through most of history, have been characterized by poor equipment, poor training, but almost superhuman courage, the one way to win victory with them was to march them forward regardless of losses. Suvorov’s victories were therefore bloody ones.",asimov
705,"Ismail (or, more correctly, Izmail) is, as Byron says, on the left bank (that is, the northern side of an eastward flowing river) of the Danube. The city is in southern Bessarabia, a province which in the time in which this canto is set (1790) was part of the Ottoman empire. In 1812 Russia wrested the province from the Turks and in Byron’s time, province and city were Russian. (In 1856, in the aftermath of Russia’s defeat in the Crimean War, the province was transferred to the new nation of Romania. It went back to Russia in 1878, back to Romania in 1918, and to the Soviet Union in 1945.)",asimov
706,"Izmail is some forty miles upstream from the mouth of the Danube. Since a verst (a Russian unit of distance) is about ⅔ of a mile, this distance represents sixty versts, and not quite eighty as Byron says. A toise is a French unit of distance, equal to about two yards, so that the circumference of the walls of the city is given as some three and a half miles.
Byron obtained the detail on Izmail, its siege and its storming, from a French book entitled (in English) |||italics|||Essay on the Ancient and Modern History of New Russia|||/italics||| by Marquis Gabriel de Castelnau, published in three volumes in 1820. By “New Russia” is meant central and southern Ukraine (see note 738), most of which had been Russian territory for less than half a century at the time the book was written.

708,"The legend of St. George arose in medieval times. It tells of a Christian martyr who lived in Palestine and who died in 303 during the last great Roman persecution of the Christians. The event in George’s life which attracted most notice was his rescue of a maiden from the wicked jaws of a dragon — which he slew. He was always portrayed as clad in armor “cap-à-pie” (from a French phrase meaning “from head to foot”) with a lance on rest, facing the dragon. The appearance and deed were knightly and to the medieval Norman rulers of England, St. George appeared to be the right kind of saint. Edward III (1312–1377) fancied himself a knight and adopted St. George as England’s patron saint; hence Byron calls him “our St. George.”",asimov

The Cossacks included Poles, Ukranians, Russians, Turks, and so on.
During the sixteenth century the Poles and Russians strove to bring the Cossack bands under control, for they were magnificent horsemen and hardy fighters — a danger if left to themselves, but a huge asset if absorbed. After the time of Peter the Great it was clear that the Russians would win the race, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries they were the mainstay of the Russian army and the chief support of the throne against internal unrest. Naturally, however, though Russian soldiers might be called Cossacks generally, this is poetic license. Most were not.",asimov

Even in the two-century period when St. Petersburg was the capital, Moscow remained the true heart of Russia as far as the Russians themselves were concerned. Buried deep in the core of at least the European portion of the nation, it represented them far more than did the more-than-half-German St. Petersburg.",asimov

In the case of Englishmen, such particularly common surnames as Thomson and Smith, with first names as common as Jack, Bill, and Jemmy (James) would be used most frequently. Naturally, some real and even important people may have such names and Byron satirically pretends that the Jemmy Thomsons called themselves so in honor of James Thomson (1700–1748), the first of the nature poets, whose best-known hold on fame is that he wrote the words to “Rule, Britannia.”",asimov

They remained in control for three centuries, and during that time the Russians were out of touch with the currents of change in the rest of Europe. Because the Russians seemed backward and uncivilized to the polished aristocrats of the West and because it was assumed there had been interbreeding, one could, and often did, flippantly refer to Russians as “Tartars.” Napoleon, on St. Helena, had said bitterly, “Scratch a Russian and you’ll find a Tartar.” Well, he should know, to his sorrow.",asimov

721,"Byron satirizes the attitudes of many Englishmen who viewed the Frenchmen as their traditional and eternal foe. The English and French had been fighting since 1066, when the Normans from northern France had conquered England. The high points, for the English, were the battle of Agincourt in 1415 and the battle of Waterloo in 1815. Oddly enough (and Byron couldn’t possibly have guessed it), Waterloo was the last battle the English and the French were to fight. Since then, they have been allies in three wars, the Crimean, World War I, and World War II, and opponents in none.
John Bull, as a symbol of the Englishman, originated in 1712 with a political satire written by John Arbuthnot (1667–1735) against the Duke of Marlborough (see note 389) and entitled |||italics|||The History of John Bull|||/italics|||.

734,"Gregory Alexandrovich Potëmkin (1739–1791) was the most famous of the lovers of Catherine II. Though he remained her love for only five years, from 1771 to 1776, he stayed on as her prime minister (so to speak) for the rest of his life. He brought attention to himself first in 1769 when he fought with reckless bravery against the Turks (hence Byron’s remark in preceding stanza that his manhood could not be called in question—to say nothing of the fact that he kept Catherine satisfied for five years—and that were he not a Hercules of strength he would have been quickly killed).
He was in charge of the military effort against the Turks at the time of the siege of Izmail, the last task of his life. In 1791 he returned to St. Petersburg, where his intrigues displeased the Empress. She sent him back to Bessarabia to conduct peace negotiations with the Turks. Forty miles short of the goal he developed a fever, and when he insisted on overeating voraciously, he suffered agonies of intestinal cramps (to which Byron refers as “indigestion”). He was placed under a tree by his distracted attendants, for they were far from any sentiment, and there he died in the “province he head wasted” with warfare.",asimov
735,"The ancient Spartans (see note 116) cultivated the habit of speaking briefly and concisely. The district surrounding the city of Sparta was Laconia, so that to speak tersely (as Potëmkin iss about to be described as doing) is to be “laconic.”",asimov
736,"Potëmkin’s headquarters were at Iasi (or Jassy), a town on a tributary of the Prut River and about 140 miles north of Izmail. He had been supervising the siege of the fortress for seven moths and he was growing impatient. The failure to take it was damaging his reputation. In Iasi he eased his growing moroseness by surrounding himself with soft living. In an effort to amuse him, one of the ladies at his sultanlike “court” pretended to tell his fortune in the cards and to predict that Izmail would fall in three weeks. Potëmkin, galvanized into action, said he would do better than that. He called for Suvorov, who almost always accomplished the tasks he was set (and who never counted the cost), and ordered him to take Izmail in three days.",asimov
737,"To the Moslems, pork is forbidden as an article of diet. To “save one’s bacon” is a slang expression meaning to save one’s life.

However, he finds this blind joy, where no joy should be, common elsewhere, too, as (see the previous stanza) in contemporary Britain. One is reminded of the almost hysterical joy in the European capitals when World War I broke out. It was the last time of joy over war. By World War II everyone had learned better.",asimov

743,"Suvorov was quite old. He was sixty-one years of age at the time of the siege of Izmail. He was also small in stature and eccentric. For instance, he insisted on leading the life of a common soldier on a campaign and sharing their privations—something even two-bit, incompetent officers in the Russian army of the time knew better than to do. (They didn’t often win victories either.) Suvorov also had a biting wit that made him many enemies, and his clownishness sometimes placed him under the suspicion of being mad.",asimov

Jacob dreamed about “a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it” (Genesis 28:12). The ladders used during sieges are used for the ascent and descent of soldiers, who are certainly little enough like angels.",asimov

Byron, with grand indifference, doesn’t bother to explain in detail. Presumably, Baba the eunuch, afraid that the Sultana will either order his own execution, along with that of Juan and Dudu, as knowing too much or that she would order his execution afterward in regret for that of Juan, arranged an escape.

764,"George Washington (1732–1799), as every American knows, was commander in chief of the American armies during the American Revolution. Byron admired him as an exponent of liberty and, no doubt, also because he fought against a conservative British government and won.

773,"Frederick (1712–1786), the son of Frederick William I of Prussia, was an effeminate and homosexual prince, whom his disgusted father nearly had executed as one who would ruin the land when he succeeded to the throne. Surprisingly enough (and there probably wasn’t anyone in Europe who wasn’t surprised), he turned out to be one of the great military leaders of all time. As Frederick II, he was the greatest king Prussia was ever to have. He came to be known as Frederick the Great and was the last of Europe’s legitimate sovereigns to deserve that epithet.
He came to the throne in 1740 and almost at once seized the province of Silesia from Austria, on whose throne was Maria Theresa. It seemed that under the uncertain rule of a woman, Austria should sink into chaos and be unable to respond. As it happened, Maria Theresa turned out to be a great monarch in her own right, but the Austrian generals were no match for Frederick.
In his first major battle, that at Mollwitz on April 10–11, 1741, however, Frederick was humiliated. His army (superbly trained under his father) won, but Frederick himself panicked at a local advance of the Austrians, and fled. The next morning, far from the scene of battle, he was chagrined to receive the news that his army, without him, had won the battle. He learned the lesson from that that “one should never despair too soon,” and he observed that lesson in many dark days ahead.",asimov

In 1795 Sir Laurence Parsons agreed and suggested that the Irish were descended from the Carthaginians. This is actually quite wrong. The Punic language was a Semitic tongue closely akin to Hebrew while the Celtic language of the Irish is Indo-European. There is no closer relationship between Irish and Carthaginian than between Swedish and Arabic.",asimov

825,"The Pharisees were a religious party among the Jews in Roman times whom Jesus denounced: “Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!” (Luke 11, 44). “Pharisaic” has therefore come to mean “hypocritical.”",asimov
826,Well-bred people supposedly find it difficult to endure harsh language and a satirist might suppose that they can stand any evil as long as that evil is not spoken of plainly. Thus Pope in his |||italics|||Moral Essays|||/italics||| has a line which speaks of one “who never mentions Hell to ears polite.” It may therefore be taken that “Hell” was the |||italics|||least|||/italics||| of what Don Juan said on this occasion.,asimov
827,"Castelnau’s description of the siege of Izmail (see note 706) was taken largely from the personal reminiscences of Armand Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu (1766–1822). Du Plessis left France a little while after the outbreak of the Revolution and served in the Russian forces at Izmail when he was only twenty-four years old. Don Juan’s adventures at Izmail are modeled after Du Plessis’, as Byron admits in his Introduction to this group of cantos. Specifically, it was Du Plessis who rescued the little girl under the circumstances described here.
In 1791, the year after the siege, Du Plessis succeeded to his dukedom. In 1803 he became governor of Odessa and later governed much of the Ukraine with skill and efficiency. After Napoleon’s fall, he served twice as Prime Minister of France. He died at just about the time this canto was being written.",asimov

831,"“Swedish Charles” is Charles XII of Sweden (1682–1718), variously called the “Alexander of the North” and “Madman of the North,” with the latter name somewhat more just. He became king at fifteen and, like Alexander, mowed down his numerically superior enemies with amazing ease. Unlike Alexander, he fought one battle too many, meeting his disaster at the battle of Poltava (deep in the Ukraine) where he was defeated by Peter the Great in 1709. He fled to Bender, in what was then Turkish territory, 110 miles north of Izmail. He persuaded the Turkish Sultan to declare war on Russia but was held as prisoner himself because he stubbornly insisted on considering himself a conquering king rather than a defeated refugee and obstinately refused to treat the Turks with the proper tact.",asimov
832,“Nazarene” was a word used by the Moslems for Christians who considered Jesus of Nazareth to be the Messiah.,asimov
833,"“Aroynt” or “aroint” means “begone.” Its best-known use is in Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Macbeth|||/italics||| where the First Witch describes a sailor’s wife saying to her, “Aroint thee, witch!” (I, iii, 6).",asimov

835,"A cockney was originally the name given to small imperfect yolkless eggs occasionally laid by hens. Legend had them “cock’s eggs” or, in older English, “cocken ey,” which became “cockney.” This name was applied to anything that was foolish, imperfect, dwarfish, or spoiled, and the sturdy yeomen of the countryside thought it fit for the pallid city folk — eventually to certain Londoners in particular.",asimov

839,"A Roman legend has it that when Romulus first founded Rome in 753 B.C., the earliest Roman settlers experienced a shortage of women. Romulus therefore invited the menfolk of surrounding Sabine tribes to a celebration of games. While the men were away from home, the Romans raided their towns and carried off their women. Naturally, this “rape of the Sabine women” meant war — which was brought to an end through the intercession of the women themselves who had fallen in love with their Roman husbands (according to Roman legend, remember). Consequently, a Roman sort of Sabine wedding means forcible abduction.",asimov
840,"“Timour” is Timur Lenk, better known as Tamerlane (1336–1405). He was the last of the great Mongol conquerors. A descendant of Genghis Khan, he conquered Central Asia and Persia, invaded Russia, India, and Turkey, winning every battle he fought and dying at the age of seventy as he was preparing a foray toward China.",asimov
841,"“Zinghis” is Genghis Khan (1162–1227), an ancestor of Tamerlane and perhaps the greatest conqueror the world has seen. In his lifetime, starting rom nothing, he conquered almost all of Asia. His sons and grandsons built on what he had hone and for a short time ruled the largest continuous land empire the world has ever seen (approximately the equivalent, in area, of the modern nataions of the Soviet Union and China put together).",asimov
842,"“Mene, mene, tekel, uphrasin” are the words described in the Bible as having been written on the wall by a ghostly hand during the feast of Belshazzar (see note 342). It is the original “handwriting on the wall,” for Daniel, the Jewish prophet, showed Belshazzar that it meant that Babylon was about to fall to the Persians and that very night, according to the biblical story, it did (Daniel 5:1–31).",asimov
843,"Suvorov’s statement “Glory to God and to the Empress! Izmail’s ours” was, in the original Russian, a rhymed couplet.

845,"Byron has indeed kept his promise so far, but this is the last time he calls to mind the epic structure of the poem. For the remaining cantos, plot sinks into the background and Juan appears only intermittently as the poet’s satiric thrusts deepen, intensify, and utterly take over the poem.",asimov

850,"The French poet Jean de Béranger (1780–1857) used the pun “Wellington” and “Villainton” in one of his verses. If the French try to say the former as though it were a French word spelled in that fashion, the word becomes very close to the second in pronunciation. The second word means, literally, “bad taste”. To English eyes, the second spelling brings inevitably to mind the word “villain” which Byron is perfectly willing to have it do.",asimov
851,"There is the possibility here of a pun which, according to Byron, the printer’s devil (serving as a copyreader, I suppose) pointed out. Outraged humanity, fighting off any attempt to downgrade Wellington, shouts “Nay!” — but might they not be shouting “Ney!” pronounced exactly the same way in French and therefore opposing Wellington in the very (supposed) denial?
Michel Ney (1769–1815) was the most spectacular (if not the most skillful) of Napoleon’s marshals. He was known as “the bravest of the brave” and, to be sure, he reached a pitch of unbelievable heroism in the course of the retreat from Moscow. If any fragment of Napoleon’s army was saved at all, it was because of Ney. He was the last man out of Russia, walking backward as though to face any last enemies there might be. He fought for Napoleon at Waterloo, but failed there and was executed for treason by order of the royalist French government on December 7, 1815.",asimov
852,"Lord Kinnaird was the brother of Byron’s banker. He learned in 1818 from a certain Marinet of a plot to assassinate Wellington. He informed Wellington of this but tried to protect his source. Apparently, Kinnaird was convinced that he had obtained assurance that Marinet would not be harmed, but Marinet was arrested just the same, and Wellington spoke insultingly of Kinnaird — which, as Byron says, was rather shabby of the duke.",asimov
853,"After the defeat of Napoleon, Europe’s legitimate monarchs, whom the French Revolution or Napoleon had dethroned, were restored. In France, Louis XVIII, brother of the executed Louis XVI, sat on the throne. In Spain, Ferdinand VII, who had been dethroned in 1808, reigned once more, having been restored in 1814 by Napoleon himself. In the Netherlands, William V had been deposed in 1795 but his son was restored to an enlarged kingdom that included Belgium. The numbering was started over and the son was William V.",asimov

855,"In 1807, when Portugal was threatened by Napoleon’s forces, its regent, John VI (ruling in place of an insane mother) fled to Brazil, then a colony of Portugal. With him went his second son, Pedro. Portugal was never occupied by the French, thanks to Wellington’s defense, and in 1816 John VI became king outright when his mother died. Nevertheless, he did not return to Portugal till 1821 and when he returned, he left behind his son Pedro as regent of Brazil.
Pedro was “the prince of the Brazils” referred to here. He supported the Brazilians against the reactionary policies of the Portuguese government and, as a matter of fact, just at about the time these lines were being written Brazil declared its independence and Pedro became its emperor as Pedro I.",asimov
856,"Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus was, according to Roman legend, a sternly virtuous general-turned-farmer. In the fifth century B.C. he was called from the plow to be dictator, when the Romans were menaced by the Aequians. He assumed the task, defeated the Aequians, and returned to the plow, all within sixteen days, making no attempt to capitalize on his power or on the Romans’ gratitude — something, Byron more than hints, which was far above Wellington’s virtue.",asimov
857,"Wellington was born in Dublin, so he was certainly Irish by birth, and his family had been living in Ireland for some two centuries at the time. They were, however, of English origin.",asimov
858,"The Roman poet Horace (see note 87) was patronized by the rich Gaius Cilnius Maecenas (70–8 B.C.), who made his patronage concrete by giving Horace a Sabine farm (a small estate in Sabine territory), concerning which the poet then wrote charming verses. Byron points out that Wellington’s reward was vastly greater.",asimov
859,"Epaminodas (418–362 B.C.) was the greatest of the ancient Thebans. He led the Theban army against the Spartans at Leuctra in 371 B.C. and defeater them. It was an unprecedented feat that hurled the Spartans from their military pre-eminence forever and ushered in a generation of greatness for Thebes, till she was defeated in turn by Philip of Macedon in 338 B.C. Epaminodas died, penniless, at the battle of Mantinea, just as he was defeating the Spartans a second time.",asimov
860,"George Washington was of the landed gentry and quite rich by the standards of the time, so he did not die poor like Epaminodas. However, it is true that he did not use his power to enrich himself further, and if he became first President of the new country, it was by genuine acclamation and for a fixed term that he did not try to extend indefinitely.",asimov
861,"William Pitt (1759–1806) may be considered Great Britain’s greatest Prime Minister (except possibly for Churchill). He became Prime Minister in 1783 at the age of twenty-four (!), and with one brief hiatus remained Prime Minister till his death twenty-three years later. He organized a firm and relentless opposition to Napoleon but died soon after the battle of Austerlitz, when Napoleon’s star was rising to its zenith. Byron opposed his policies but had to admit he had not used his power to enrich himself; hence he had been “ruining Great Britain gratis.”",asimov

When Hephaestion died in 324 B.C., Alexander went through the wildest extravagances of grief, in part out of real emotion presumably, but in part no doubt out of a self-conscious imitation of Achilles’ grief over Patroclus. Byron is saying that he is neither Wellington (Alexander) nor his flattering lickspittle admirer (Hephaestion). And yet, since Byron |||italics|||did|||/italics||| engage in homosexual amours, I wonder if he winced a little as he wrote the line.",asimov

866,"This is a quote from Horace, who apostrophizes the strong digestive equipment of peasants, who can live on coarse and spicy food laden with garlic. It is comforting for the well-to-do to suppose that the peasants’ alimentary canal is divinely adjusted to poor food so that he need be offered no better. Presumably, however, the upper classes, if forced to work as hard and live as poorly, would find the peasants’ crusts just as palatable as the peasants do and digest them just as well.",asimov
867,"Michel Eyquem de Montaigne (1533–1592) was an important essayist — in fact, he introduced the essay as a major literary form. Philosophically, he was a skeptic, wedded to no dogma. “Que sçais je?” means “What do I know?” — the natural question of a skeptic.",asimov

He is through trying his hand at active plotting and has serene confidence in the guidance of heaven. He says, “There is special providence in the fall of a sparrow” (V, ii, 220–221). God takes care, in other words, of the most insignificant matters.

881,"Byron was an aristocrat, remember, and a self-conscious one; even a snob. He was against tyranny and fought it with complete sincerity and with utter bravery. Still, he wanted an ideal society bestowed from above by an enlightened and benevolent ruling class. Insofar as revolutions might persuade the ruling class to benevolence, they were good. However, to have revolutions place the lower classes in a position to dictate was another thing. Byron found all forms of government unsatisfactory but said (May 1, 1821), “As for democracy, it is the worst of the whole; for what is (in fact) democracy? — an Aristocracy of Blackguards.”",asimov

883,"“Spanish fly” is the popular name given to a species of beetle that produces an irritating substance capable of raising blisters on the skin. Taken internally, the substance is excreted by way of the kidneys and in the process the genito-urinary system is irritated. This is taken by many to be an aphrodisiac effect, so that the mere mention of it by Byron is ribald. However, the remark also revers to the irritating effect on the reactionary governments of Europe of a revolutionary movement in Spain.
In January 1820 Spanish troops mutinied and forced the reactionary King Ferdinand VII to grant a constitution. Byron’s glee was premature, however. In October 1822, just one month after this canto was written the powers of Europe met at Verona and France was granted permission to deal with the Spanish situation. In January 1823 the French army marched into Spain and by August 31, two days after this canto was published, the last of the revolution was snuffed out by French arms.",asimov
884,"The “Attic Bee” was the name applied to Sophocles (495–405 B.C.), the Athenian dramatist (Attica was the peninsula on which Athens was located). He was so called from the sweetness of his compositions. Here Byron uses the Attic Bee as a symbol of the way in which Greek unrest was stinging the reactionary Establishment of Europe.

India remained under Mogul rule thereafter, with its last strong ruler, Aurangzeb (1618–1707), who might be called the “last of the Mongols.” After Aurangzeb, India began to fall apart; the French and English began to dominate portions of its coast. Even so, a Mogul continued to rule in Delhi for a generation after Byron’s death. It was Mohammed Shah, a great-grandson of Aurangzeb who was on the throne when Nadir Shah sacked his capital.",asimov

A religious man, Cuvier could not accept the long, slow development of life, since that would contradict the words of the Bible. He therefore maintained that the world was colonized by life many times and that each time, some great catastrophe ended life which then had to be created anew. It was the last creation with which the Bible dealt, and the ancient, early fossils were relics of former worlds.",asimov
895,"Mammoths are extinct elephants, adapted to life in the Arctic, and covered by shaggy fur in fashion similar to the musk ox. Some varieties were larger than modern elephants and the word “mammoth,” of obscure Russian origin, has come to mean “huge.” The animal is better known to us than most extinct monsters, partly because it lived during the Ice Age and primitive men left us paintings of it. Then, too, numbers were preserved in the Siberian ice and some have been found with the flesh remaining in such good preservation that dogs could eat it. Thus, in Byron’s time, mammoths were a good example of a species of animal belonging to the former world and no longer alive.",asimov
896,"In 1784 a fossil was discovered that seemed at first to have been the remains of some sort of sea creature. In 1801, however, Cuvier examined it and was satisfied that it had been a flying creature with wings held rigid by an immensely overgrown set of finger bones. He called it “pterodactyl” (“wingfinger”).

The riddle was “What goes on four feet in the morning, on two feet at noon and on three feet in the evening; and is weaker, the more feet it goes on?” Oedipus solved the riddle by pointing out that man crawled on all fours in the morning of life, went erect in his proud noon, and used a cane for help in the old-age evening of life, and was strongest when he went erect, weakest when a baby. On hearing this, the Sphinx killed herself, while Oedipus went on to become King of Thebes and to incur great sin and suffer great tragedy.

Peter, however, was childish and half-mad, treated his wife abominably, and would clearly ruin Russia if allowed to reign.
On July 9, after only half a year on the throne, he was forced to abdicate by a conspiracy of nobles, led by Gregory Orlov (1734–1783), who was then Catherine’s lover.

The protagonist in the play is Sir Giles Overreach, a cheat and extortionist, who at one point refers to someone thus: “His fortune swells him. ’Tis rank, he’s married.” This is a reference to one who goes up in the world through marriage, and Don Juan would be placed in that kind of marriage (at least temporarily) if he became Catherine’s lover.",asimov
914,"The quotation comes from Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Hamlet,|||/italics||| where Hamlet is describing his dead father to his remarried mother (III, iv, 59–60).",asimov
915,"The Simplon is one of the passes over the Alps, that mountain barrier that seems impassable but that was crossed both by Hannibal and by Napoleon. In 1800 Napoleon ordered a road built over the pass which was completed in 1806 — before this canto was written. (The date of completion of the Simplon Tunnel was 1905. It is 12¼ miles long and the longest in the world. In 1816 Byron crossed over the Simplon Pass in traveling from Switzerland into Italy. No doubt he would have appreciated having been able to use the tunnel.)",asimov
916,Laudanum is an alcoholic tincture of opium; “black drop” is an acid extract of opium.,asimov
917,"The word “prove” is used here in its older meaning of “test.” Alexander Pope, in his |||italics|||Eloisa to Abelard|||/italics||| has Eloisa say, “Not Caesar’s empress would I deign to prove.” That is, she wouldn’t stoop to test the position of empress without love, but would marry |||italics|||only|||/italics||| for love.",asimov

921,"Pallas was one of the epithets of the Greek goddess Athena (patroness of Athens), who was often described as gray-eyed.",asimov
922,"Valeria Messalina was the third wife of the Roman Emperor Claudius. She was executed in A.D. 48 on the grounds of immorality and treason when she was still only in her early twenties. The later scandalmongers had a field day exaggerating her adulteries into incredible nymphomania. As a result, her name has become a byword for immorality.",asimov
923,"Byron seems to forget that Catherine, far from being in the “prime of life,” is now sixty-one and that he himself commented on this in the previous canto (see note 817).",asimov
924,"The phrase is from the drinking song of Iago in Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Othello|||/italics||| (II, iii, 69).",asimov
925,Land granted in Russia included the peasants on it.,asimov
926,"Clytemnestra was the wife of Agamemnon, leader of the Greek forces at the siege of Troy (see note 85). Clytemnestra had taken a lover while Agamemnon was absent and when her lord returned, she had him murdered. This is a glance at the fact that Catherine had had her husband, Peter, murdered (see note 910). Byron might also be imlying that he would rather have died than have stayed married to Lady Byron.",asimov
927,"Elizabeth I of England (1533–1603) was widely considered a virgin, was even known as “the Virgin Queen,” and may well have been one, in a technical manner of speaking. However, she did take lovers, of whom the last was the Earl of Essex (thirty-three years younger than she) and hence was only “half-chaste.” However, Elizabeth was a tightfisted woman with money (which seemed a vice to courtiers, but was a blessing to the people and could well account for much of her popularity) and she did non shower wealth on her lovers directly as Catherine did.",asimov
928,"Robert Devereux, second Earl of Essex (1566–1601) was Queen Elizabeth I’s last favorite. Essex was an incompetent soldier and politician, however, and in the end was foolish enough to think he could organize a coup against the aged queen. The coup was quickly crushed, and Elizabeth, a queen before she was a woman, had Essex executed. Grief may have shortened her life thereafter, but she was already sixty-eight and in failing health, so how much longer would she have lived anyway?",asimov
929,"Miss Protasoff’s function was a tribute to Catherine’s highly original approach to the matter of love. When Catherine took a lover, she based her initial decision entirely on his looks, but there remained the vital point that in actual practice he might belie his looks. Therefore it was the duty of a trusted woman attendant of meticulous taste in such things to try the prospective lover in bed. If she said he would do, then Catherine would take him on. |||italics|||“L’|||/italics||||||italics|||É|||/italics||||||italics|||p|||/italics||||||italics|||rouveuse”|||/italics||| might be translated as “the testeress.”",asimov

942,"This is a reference to the Scottish lawyer Henry Peter Brougham (last name pronounced “Broom”) (1778–1868), a great reformer and moralist. Byron hated him when he discovered it was Brougham, not Jeffrey, who had written that lacerating criticism of his first book. See note 215.",asimov
