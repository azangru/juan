3,"The first two cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| were published July 15, 1819. Because of its daring, irreverent, and “immoral” character, Byron’s publisher, John Murray, decided to publish it anonymously. Not only was the author’s name omitted, but even the publisher’s, for fear of legal reprisals. Byron, on hearing this was planned, asked that the dedication (in which he vehemently attacked Robert Southey) be omitted. Me might be abusive, even scurrilous, in his anger, but he was not cowardly. He said, “I won’t attack the dog in the dark. Such things are for scoundrels and renegados like himself.”
However, the dedication is said to have got into print somehow and to have been sold separately under the counter, so to speak. Southey was aware of its contents and must have been vastly discontented over them. Eventually, after Byron was dead, the dedication was restored to its place, and here it is — one of the most successful pieces of elaborate vilification in English poetry.",asimov
4,Robert Southey (1774–1843) was an English poet whose success far outstripped his talents. His best-known poems today remain |||italics|||The Battle of Blenheim|||/italics||| composed in 1798 and |||italics|||The Inchcape Rock|||/italics||| written somewhat later. Neither is very important. Byron hated him with a fervor that seemed but to increase with time (the hate was returned) and |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is dedicated to him with savage irony.,asimov
5,"The poet laureate is a court official appointed by the British Prime Minister. The poet laureate (“laureate” means decked with laurel and therefore honored, for in ancient Greece it was the custom to grant the winners at the Olympian games wreaths of laurel leaves) was supposed to write odes in honor of the monarch on his birthday and to celebrate other official occasions in similar fashion.
The poet laureate was by no means assuredly the best poet in the nation, for there were many who would be considered ineligible because their political views were unsuitable or their poetry unedifying. And the best poets often did not want a post which they viewed as that of the government’s tame poetic spaniel.
Nevertheless, the post brought in a little money and a great deal of prestige (with the non-poetic public) and, officially at least, the poet laureate might be considered the chief of British poets (hence “representative of all the race”).
Southey was the twelfth official poet laureate, having accepted the post in 1813, five years before this dedication was written. Byron had only contempt for the man and for the post, but that did not mean that he did not chafe at the fact that the public generally, in awe of the post, were consequently impressed by the man.",asimov
6,"The Tories were the conservative party of the nation (and modern Conservatives in Britain are still often referred to as Tories). They were the spokesmen of the landed gentry, of the established Church, of the Crown. In short, they represented what we would today call the Establishment.
Southey, in his youth, had been caught up (like many other young Englishmen of the time) in the revolutionary fervor that accompanied the French Revolution of 1789. With age, however, Southey became steadily more conservative and eventually became a pillar of the Tories and one of their most dependable spokesmen. In this respect, he was like a number of other literary figures who had been revolutionaries in their youth but who had hardened and yellowed with age and prosperity, so that Southey’s change had “lately been a common case”. Byron, who remained revolutionary and bitterly anti-Establishment to the end of his days, felt self-righteously superior to those he considered traitors to their youthful ideals, and his contempt for them knew no bounds.",asimov
7,"Southey, along with certain of the other poets-turned-conservative preached the joys of nature (safer, in a way, for conservatives, than considering the human condition) and made their home in the beautiful Lake District of Lancashire, Cumberland, and Westmoreland, just south of the Scottish border. They were referred to as the “Lake poets” and Byron converts that into the derisory “Lakers.”",asimov
8,"Since the Lakers were now conservative and sang the glories of King and Establishment, they might be compared to Mother Goose’s “four and twenty Blackbirds.” The use of the spelling “pye” is a reference to Henry James Pye, a particularly bad poet who had served as poet laureate from 1790 to 1813 and is otherwise a cipher in literary history. It was his death that put Southey in that seat, reflecting glory on his brother Lakers so that “Which pye being open’d they began to sing.”",asimov
9,"At the time Byron began |||italics|||Don Juan |||/italics|||in 1818, George III was still King of Great Britain and Ireland. He had by then been reigning for fifty-eight years, but had been subject to periods of mental imbalance and after 1811 had been permanently insane. His eldest son, Prince George, was officially declared Regent in 1811. The Prince Regent was a most licentious man, which in itself Byron would scarcely have objected to. However, as Prince of Wales, he had been at continual odds with his father and had therefore allied himself with the liberal Whigs. Once he became Regent, however, he broke with the Whigs and aligned himself with the Tories. He might therefore be expected to “admire such kind of food,” i. e., the praise of other renegades.",asimov
10,"Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1772–1834), unlike Southey, is recognized today (at his best) one of the giants among the poets. He is known today for the magnificent |||italics|||Rime of the Ancient Mariner|||/italics||| (1798) and |||italics|||Kubla Khan|||/italics||| (1797). Byron sympathized with the chronically impoverished Coleridge and had helped him financially and with recommendations. However, Coleridge, who had been liberal in his youth, also turned conservative in religion and in politics. Worse yet, from Byron’s standpoint, he was and remained a friend of Southey’s and no friend of Southey could be anything but a target for Byron’s ridicule.
Coleridge, in middle age, grew interested in German philosophy. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant had published his |||italics|||Critique of Pure Reason|||/italics||| in 1781 and introduced in it a system of thought called “transcendentialism.” Coleridge, in his |||italics|||Biographia Literaria|||/italics|||, published in 1817, was the first to undertake an explanation of this to the English-speaking world.",asimov
11,"Kant’s philosophy is notoriously difficult to understand, all the more so since it was written in the very best German-opaque. Coleridge, for all his ability to handle English, didn’t succeed in making it much clearer.",asimov
12,“A dry Bob” seems to have been then-current slang for intercourse without ejaculation (“lack of moisture”). The use of the phrase shocked and (of course) titillated the public and was a particularly effective way of indicating that Southey went through the motions of writing poetry without producing anything poetic.,asimov
13,"William Wordsworth (1770–1850) was the most successful English poet of his time. His publications of |||italics|||Lyrical Ballads|||/italics||| in 1798, in collaboration with Coleridge, was a landmark in English literary history, Like Coleridge and Southey, he was a radical in his youth and grew conservative with success.
In 1790 he settled in Grasmere in the Lake Country and remained there for the rest of his life. It was round him that the other Lake poets gathered.",asimov
14,"Although many of Wordsworth’s youthful poems are first-class, he wrote himself out by the time he was forty, and the last half of his long life shows only occasional flashes of power. His long poem |||italics|||The Excursion,|||/italics||| published in 1814, shows none of them and was almost entirely pedestrian. Nevertheless, Wordsworth lived to succeed Southey as poet laureate in 1843, something that would have stirred Byron’s profoundest disgust, had he lived to see it.",asimov
15,"The “dog-star” is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky (so-called because it is in the constellation Canis Major, or Great Dog). It rises close to dawn during the months of July and August and, in ancient times, was thought to radiate a significant quantity of heat, thus making those months particularly hot. This is not so, of course, but the hottest part of summer is still referred to as the “dog days”. Since great heat can induce sunstroke and can, even short of that, make anyone snappish and unreasonable, men were supposed to be more likely to go mad during the dog days. Hence Byron’s comment implies that only madmen would consider Wordsworth’s |||italics|||Excursion|||/italics||| to be poetry.",asimov
16,"The Tower of Babel was an attempt, according to the Bible, to raise a building high enough to scale heaven (Genesis 11:1–9). It is therefore the epitome of the skyscraper and to add another story to it is a way of signifying the impossible. In punishment for the attempt to build the Tower, those planning the structure were stricken by God with a confusion of tongues so that there is also the secondary implication that |||italics|||The Excursion|||/italics||| is incoherent.",asimov
17,"Keswick is the chief town of the Lake District. Coleridge lived there from 1800 to 1809, and Southey lived there all his life after 1803. Wordsworth lived only twelve miles to the south.",asimov
18,"Byron had traveled all over Europe (and was indeed, at the time he wrote this, living in Venice in permanent exile from his native land). He could not help sneering at the Lake poets for their narrow provincialism as compared with himself.",asimov
19,"It is not unknown for some person who has been of worth to the nation in the arts or sciences to be given some sinecure in the bureaucracy, to serve as a source of money and prestige. In 1813 Wordsworth was awarded the Distributorship of Stamps for the county of Westmoreland. The stamps were used as a method of taxation, hence “his place in the Excise.” Naturally, it made Wordsworth a mark for liberals like Byron who affected to believe it was for that salary that he had gone over to the Conservative side and, for fear of losing it, that he remained there.",asimov
20,"Sir Walter Scott (1771–1832) was a Scottish poet whose success came with |||italics|||The Lay of the Last Minstrel,|||/italics||| published in 1805, which contains the great set of patriotic lines that begins “Breathes there a man with soul so dead...” Byron wrote satirically at Scott’s expense in his youth, but the good-natured Scott returned pleasant words for unkind ones, and in the end they were good friends, even though Scott was, and remained, a Tory. Scott was lame from an attack of poliomyelitis in babyhood and this may have helped endear him to the self-consciously clubfooted Byron. Scott was offered the laureateship on the death of Pye, but he refused it, something which also counted in his favor as far as Byron was concerned.",asimov
21,"Samuel Rogers (1763–1855) was quite a second-rate poet, whose only literary fame came with the publication of |||italics|||The Pleasures of Memory|||/italics||| in 1792. The phrase “Not dead but gone before,” seen on many a tombstone now, is his. He was a kindly gentleman who gave good parties, was financially generous to other poets, and was a friend of Byron’s. He lived long enough to be offered the laureateship on Wordsworth’s death but refused it, and no doubt the shade of Byron approved.",asimov
22,"Thomas Campbell (1777–1844) was a Scottish poet who wrote patriotic verse (|||italics|||Ye Mariners of England,|||/italics||| 1800) and ballads (|||italics|||Lord Ullin’s Daughter, |||/italics|||1804). He was, and remained, a liberal, not only supporting the French Revolution, but also denouncing the partition of Poland and inveighing against Negro slavery. He received a pension from the Crown in 1803, but apparently Byron didn’t mind that. He and Rogers (see note 21) were about the only contemporary British writers never to suffer shafts of Byronic satire.",asimov
23,"Thomas Moore (1779–1852) was an Irish poet whose first fame came with |||italics|||Odes of Anacreon,|||/italics||| published in 1800. Some of the verses he wrote to “traditional airs” are still well-known: |||italics|||The Harp That Once Through Tara’s Halls; Believe Me, If Those Endearing Young Charms; The Last Rose of Summer; |||/italics|||and so on.
Byron’s early ridicule drove Moore to demand a duel, but Byron made good-humored amends. Thereafter, Byron always admired Moore, and the admiration was returned. Moore’s most successful work in his own time was |||italics|||Lalla Rookh|||/italics||| (1817) and that was written in Byronic style. He visited Byron during the latter’s exile in Italy ans even though Moore advised against publication of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| because of its ribaldry, their friendship remained close. Byron left him his memoirs to publish, but Moore (in an attack of unforgivable prudence) decided to burn them. In 1830, though, he used information that survived to publish |||italics|||Letters and Journals of Lord Byron|||/italics||| which included a biography.",asimov
24,"George Crabbe (1754–1832) achieved fame only late in life. He was a nature poet, like the Lakers, but preferred to be realistic and not merely sentimental. Of this, Byron approved.",asimov
25,"The result of the trial would not have pleased Byron, alas. None of the poets named in this verse, despite Byron’s approval, were destined to compete with Wordsworth and Coleridge in the eyes of posterity, though Scott at least probably transcends Southey.",asimov
26,"The Muses were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne (memory) in the Greek myths. In the days before writing was common, epic poetry and other forms of literary endeavor were transmitted by word of mouth and had to be committed to memory. A correct recitation was the daughter of memory so it was natural for a poet to invoke the Muse before launching into a large effort. Eventually, nine Muses were listed, each for a special branch of art. As a result, “muse” became a metaphor for poetic inspiration and Byron, with only mock modesty, you may be sure, speaks of his own as pedestrian.",asimov
27,"Pegasus was a winged horse in Greek myth. According to one tale, Pegasus once alighted upon Mount Helicon, the traditional home of the Muses, and where his foot struck, a spring appeared, since called Hippocrene (horse-fountain). The waters of Hippocrene, through association with Helicon and the Muses, became symbolic of the bubbling upward of poetic inspiration. By further association, Pegasus, soaring high above the earth on his beautiful wings, became the symbol of the flight of poetry. Byron’s irony places the Lake poets on Pegasus in contrast to his own “pedestrian Muse.”",asimov
28,"It is obvious that Byron emphatically does not follow his own advice, but then few people do.",asimov
29,"The Greek god of the sun, Helios, was the son of Hyperion, who was one of the Titans, a group of gods who ruled the universe before Zeus and his fellow Olympians took over. The sun can be referred to, poetically, as Helios, or Hyperion, or, as in this case, Titan.",asimov
30,"John Milton (1608–1674) was greatly admired by Byron. For one thing, Milton was a revolutionary in his time. He was the great Puritan poet and he was on the side of Parliament in its war with King Charles I that began in 1642. His eloquent pen wrote in defense of the Parliamentary cause even to the justification of the execution of Charles in 1649. The shadows gathered, however. His eyesight failed, and in 1652, before his forty-fourth birthday, he was totally blind. In 1661 the monarchy was restored and those who returned to power accused Milton of treason. For a while he was in actual danger of his life.
In 1663, at the very nadir of his fortunes, he completed |||italics|||Paradise Lo|||/italics||||||italics|||st,|||/italics||| the greatest serious epic poem in English literary history (as |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is the greatest comic one). At the midpoint of the poem, near the beginning of Book VII, Milton wrote:
|||comment-quote|||...I sing with mortal voice, unchanged
To hoarse or mute, though fallen on evil days,
On evil days though fallen and evil tongues,
In darkness, and with dangers compassed round,
And solitude...|||/comment-quote|||
No doubt, Byron saw in this a comparison to his own situation, exiled from England and execrated for his irregular way of life by the pious hypocrites (so he considered them) he had left behind.",asimov
31,"In 1660, when the English were getting ready to bring back Charles I’s son to reign as Charles II, Milton wrote a pamphlet denouncing such a restoration, knowing full well that if that restoration succeeded (and it looked very much as though it would) he might be executed. He did not “loathe the Sire [Charles I] to laud the Son [Charles II]” but remained constant to his views — something Byron contrasts to the actions of Southey and the others.",asimov
32,"Samuel was the Old Testament prophet who first anointed Saul king of Israel and then broke with him. In the crisis of Saul’s life just before a climactic battle with the Philistines, Saul tried to raise the spirit of the dead Samuel (I Samuel 28:7–20) to gain guidance. When Samuel was raised, however, he horrified Saul by predicting defeat and death for him.",asimov
33,"Milton’s last years were spent not only with blindness, but with gout and poverty. The legend arose that his daughters were heartless and cruel to him, but it may well have been that he himself was captious and overly demanding.",asimov
34,"Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh (1769–1822), was Foreign Secretary from 1812 to 1822. In the years following Waterloo, he kept Great Britain on the side of those Continental monarchies who attempted to crush the forces of liberalism in Europe. This made him anathema to the English liberals, and no one was more vivid in execrations against him than Byron was. He was also identified with repressive policies at home.
Byron’s phrase “intellectual eunuch” is double-barreled. He might well be impugning Castlereagh’s intelligence and it is true that Castlereagh was a bad orator and therefore sounded stupid at times. The phrase might refer more literally to a real or fancied hyposexuality, for through his long marriage of thirty-five years, Castlereagh had no child. This second implication is reinforced by Byron’s deliberate use of “its” for “his” in the succeeding verses.",asimov
35,"Castlereagh’s father was an Irish landowner, and his own first public office was in the Irish parliament in 1790. He became chief secretary to the lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1798, and played a key role in the firm suppression of an Irish rebellion in that year. British fright at the prospect of a French landing in Ireland made the repression a bloody one and Castlereagh was gladly handed the blame for that by the liberals.",asimov
36,"Castlereagh left Ireland in 1805, to take up his first post in the British cabinet as Secretary of War.",asimov
37,"After the defeat of Napoleon, Castlereagh supported the reactionary policies initiated by Prince Klemens von Metternich of Austria though Castlereagh’s secret diplomacy (unknown to the liberals) served to soften the harsh intentions of the Continental powers.",asimov
38,"Ixion was punished, in Greek myth, for his attempt to rape the goddess Hera by being tied to a fiery wheel that turned endlessly in Tartarus, that part of the underworld reserved for the torture of those who angered the gods. Ixion’s wheel is thus a poetic metaphor for the “endless torments and perpetual motion” to which Byron compares Castlereagh’s droning and uncertain oratory.",asimov
39,"The reactionary policies of Austria, Russia, and Prussia, under their guiding spirit, Metternich, did not, in the years after Waterloo, successfully prevent all expression of liberalism. The Congress of Vienna (1814) had marked out the map of Europe as it was to be after Napoleon, but Castlereagh tried to institute a regular system of periodic meetings of the great powers to take up emergencies that might arise. This dim preview of a League of Nations was mocked by Byron as indicating that the reactionaries couldn’t settle things once and for all, but had to keep patching. Indeed, even as this dedication was being written, the powers were meeting in the first postwar congress at Aix-la-Chapelle, on the western boundaries of Prussia, to consider methods for uplifting France from the outcast role she had been placed in after Waterloo and restoring her to her position as a great power.",asimov
40,"Here, again, the matter of the “intellectual eunuch” is brought up, for Castlereagh’s mind is “emasculated to the marrow”. Eutropius was a eunuch, literally, who served as a minister to the East Roman Emperor Arcadius from 395 to 398. His reputation in history was that of a vile and corrupt intriguer and he came to a bad end, being executed in 399. (Castlereagh also came to a bad end, perhaps even more tragic, four years after these words were written. Byron could not know that now — though he might hope.)",asimov
41,"No one could doubt Castlereagh’s physical courage; that was proved many times. In 1809 he fought a duel with his political rival (and eventual successor) George Canning and wounded him, thus fulfilling the ritualistic display of courage the times required. But to Byron, unwilling to allow Castlereagh any virtues at all, courage, too, becomes a vice.",asimov
42,"During the Napoleonic era, Italy was freed from its old Australian-dominated dynasties and new states were set up which were in theory free, but were actually dominated by France. Byron accepted that theory and could look back a few years and refer to Italy’s “late reviving Roman soul.” After the defeat of Napoleon, the domination was turned back from France to Austria, and now it was the reactionaries of Europe who considered Italy free. |||italics|||This|||/italics||| time the theory is a “lie” to Byron.
Talk of freedom must have seemed particularly ridiculous to Byron since Lombardy and Venetia which, before Napoleon’s time, had been independent states, were now made part of the Austrian Empire. Byron had come to Italy in the fall of 1817 and it was in Venice (now part of Austria) that he wrote the dedication and the first two cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||.",asimov
43,The “buff and blue” were colors used in the uniforms of those associated with the Whig Club and came to be the badge of the liberal party of the Whigs.,asimov
44,Hercules was the giant strong man of Greek mythology and the very personification of brute strength. “Herculean” refers to anything that requires the strength of a Hercules.,asimov
45,"Julian (331–363) was a Roman emperor from 361 to 363. Although the emperors had been Christian for a generation and Julian had himself been brought up a Christian and had pretended to be one, he doffed that religion once he became emperor. He revealed himself a pagan an did his best to revive paganism as a force within the empire. In this he failed, and his reign represented the last attempt to stem the Christian tide. Later Christian historians referred to him as “Julian the Apostate” (an apostate being one who abandons the cause he had at one time supported). Byron’s final slap at Southey, then, is to make him “Ultra-Julian,” that is worse than Julian in his apostasy.
The dedication, which here ends, was completed on September 16, 1818.",asimov
46,"Canto I was written between September 6 and November 1, 1818, in Venice, Italy.",asimov
47,"The gazettes were not then, as now in the American sense of the word, simply newspapers. They were official weekly journals, publishing statistics of governmental interest: movements of the royal family, lists of honors granted, those killed in battle, and so on. Byron refers to the gazettes now and then in |||italics|||Don Juan,|||/italics||| chiefly in order to bestow a sardonic glance at their role as a military obituary list.",asimov
48,"Don Juan is an “ancient friend” because he was a well-known figure out of Spanish folklore. He first received recognized literary presentation in a drama |||italics|||El Burlador de Sevilla|||/italics|||, written in 1630 by the Spanish dramatist Gabriel Téllez (who wrote under the pseudonym Tirso de Molina).
In the original folk tale, Don Juan was the epitome of the licentious man, who aspired (usually successfully) to make love to every woman he met, and who did so with utter disregard for any law. The climax of his story is his liaison with a noblewoman and its consequences. He kills the woman’s father in a duel. The father is buried and an effigy of him is placed over the tomb. Don Juan, seeing that effigy, mockingly invites it to dinner. The stone figure duly arrives at the meal and drags the rake and blasphemer to Hell.
Various versions of this legend had already appeared in Spain and elsewhere by Byron’s time. Molière had written an play on the theme and Mozart, an opera. Byron, with no compunction whatever, utterly alters the plot in his own version. In fact, all that Byron leaves of the traditional Don Juan, is his name and birthplace; |||italics|||nothing more!|||/italics||| Don Juan’s character is utterly changed. From a heartless blasphemer, seducer, and libertine (as the world viewed Byron), he becomes an innocent, far more sinned against than sinning (as Byron viewed himself). Even the hero’s name is tampered with for Byron abandons the universal “Don Wahn” and calls him, with sturdy English disregard for the eccentric pronunciation of foreigners, “Don Joo’un,” as we can tell by the fact that he rhymes Juan with “new one” and “true one.”",asimov
49,"Don Juan was also a favorite in pantomimes and puppet shows, particularly one adapted from the play |||italics|||The Libertine|||/italics||| by Thomas Shadwell. The climax of such shows invariably came at the point where Don Juan, defiant to the last, is dragged down to Hell by the devil to the screaming enthusiasm of the audience.",asimov
50,"Edward Vernon (1684–1757) was an English admiral who wore a grogram cloak (one woven of coarse silk) in bad weather and was consequently called “Old Grog”. He was the first to issue rations of rum and water to the crew. Diluted liquor, and then liquor of any kind, came to be known as “grog” in sailor slang.",asimov
51,"William Augustus (1721–1765), a son of George II of Great Britain and an uncle of George III, was created Duke of Cumberland in 1726. In 1745 he headed the British forces fighting off the last Stuart attempt to regain the throne. On April 16, 1746, he defeated the Scottish adherents of “Bonnie Prince Charlie” at Culloden, then pursued and crushed the fleeing rebels with sufficient cruelty to wipe out Stuart hopes forever and to earn for himself the nickname “the butcher”.",asimov
52,"James Wolfe (1727–1759) was an English general who fought with Cumberland against the Stuarts, but gained his chief fame in North America. In 1759 he led the British forces against Quebec, defeated the French, and, in effect, took Canada. Wolfe, however, was mortally wounded and died at the moment of victory.",asimov
53,"Edward Hawke (1705–1781), an English admiral, reached the peak of his career in 1759, too. In this year Hawke defeated the French fleet off the southern shore of Britany.",asimov
54,"Ferdinand (1721–1792) was the son of Ferdinand Albert II of Brunswick. He fought under Frederick the Great of Prussia in the Seven Years’ War, in which Britain was Frederick’s ally. When Ferdinand beat the French in two land battles in 1758 and 1759, he qualified as a British hero.",asimov
55,"John Manners, Marquis of Granby (1721–1770), was commander in chief of the British forces fighting in Germany in alliance with Frederick the Great during the Seven Years’ War.",asimov
56,"John Burgoyne (1722–1792) is best remembered (particularly in the United States) for the defeat of his army and his surrender at Saratoga, New York, in 1777. This was the turning point of the American Revolution.",asimov
57,"Augustus Keppel (1725–1786) was an English admiral, best known for his failure to defeat the French at sea in 1778 during the American Revolution.",asimov
58,"Sir William Howe (1729–1814) was an English general, best known as the British commander at the Battle of Bunker Hill in 1775 and his capture of New York in 1776. On the whole, though, and partly because he rather sympathized with the American cause, he failed in his task of crushing the American rebellion and resigned his command in 1778.",asimov
59,"One indication of fame in the England of Byron’s time was the use of the figure of a man or woman as the sign for a public house. In a society which was largely illiterate, signs in the form of images rather than words were useful. Thus, in Charles Dickens’ |||italics|||Pickwick Papers|||/italics|||, Samuel Weller’s mother-in-law (i. e. stepmother) owned a public house known as “Marquis of Granby”",asimov
60,"All of the eighteenth-century generals and admirals listed by Byron in the first two lines of this verse had utterly paled before the glory of Arthur Wellesley. He fought successfully in India, then in Spain against Napoleon’s generals (where, in 1809, he became Viscount Wellington). He fought his way through Spain into France and, after Napoleon’s first abdication, he was made Duke of Wellington. He commanded the British forces in the climactic and victorious battle of Waterloo in 1815.
Wellington was hated by Byron as firmly as Castlereagh and Southey were, since Wellington was as staunch a pillar of reaction in post-Napoleonic Britain and, worse, was idolized by the public. Byron lists only military and political heroes in this verse and those following, perhaps because it was of this group that “a new one” was constantly appearing and then found out as “not the true one”. It is very likely that Byron was pleased at being able to point out the evanescence of military and political glory (as opposed, perhaps, to literary glory) because he hated war and despised the kind of politics then current. It gave him the chance to imply that Wellington in his turn would be soon forgotten. (But, alas for Byron, he wasn’t.)",asimov
61,"In Act IV, scene i of Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Macbeth|||/italics|||, the ghost of Banquo (whom Macbeth had caused to be assassinated) at one point leads a procession of eight future kings of Scotland in order to triumph over his assassin, who is watching in frustration, since the kings are to be Banquo’s descendants and not his own. One by one, in stately fashion, the kings move across the stage.",asimov
62,"Napoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), or Buonaparte in the Italian spelling, was the most remarkable general of modern times. He dominated France from 1799, becoming emperor in 1804. He defeated all Europe in spectacular victories, then suffered equally spectacular defeats. His final defeat and exile came in 1815 and at the time this canto was written he had been in exile at the lonely island of St. Helena for three years. Byron and indeed a whole generation of Europeans was fascinated by Napoleon’s extraordinary rise and catastrophic fall.",asimov
63,"Charles François Dumouriez (1739–1823) was a French general who won the minor skirmish at Valmy in 1792, an incident that preserved the republic from the first assault of the surrounding monarchies. He was a moderate, however, and the next year deserted to the Austrians before the radicals could have him recalled and executed.",asimov
64,"The |||italics|||Moniteur|||/italics||| and |||italics|||Courier|||/italics||| were French newspapers, the former being the official government spokesman under Napoleon.",asimov
65,"Antoine P. J. M. Barnave (1761–1793) was a French politician who was active in revolutionary affairs, but whose moderation the Revolution outpaced; he was guillotined during the Reign of Terror.",asimov

68,"Honoré Gabriel Riqueti, Comte de Mirabeau (1749–1791) was a moderate revolutionary who dominated France during the first two years after the fall of the Bastille and who might possibly have kept France a limited monarchy had he not died of natural causes while still comparatively young.",asimov
69,"Jérôme Pétion de Villeneuve (1756–1794) was mayor of Paris from 1791 to 1792 and was moderate enough to be in danger later on. He was imprisoned in 1793 but escaped. Rather than let himself be retaken (when that seemed likely), he killed himself.",asimov
70,"Jean Baptiste du Val-de-Grâce, Baron de Cloots (1755–1794), was an ultra-revolutionary, whose extreme views against religion brought him to the guillotine in 1794 for being |||italics|||too|||/italics||| radical. (It was hard to win in those days.)",asimov
71,"George Jaques Danton (1759–1794) was the most colorful of the leaders of the French Revolution. He arranged for the execution of the moderates such as Barnave and the radicals such as Cloots, but in the end went to the guillotine himself.",asimov
72,"Jean Paul Marat (1743–1793) was one of the radical revolutionaries, who consistently denounced all moderates and as consistently advocated violence.

73,"Marie Joseph du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757–1834), is best known to Americans as a young and enthusiastic foreign volunteer fighting under Washington.

80,Horatio Nelson (1758–1805) was a British admiral during the wars against revolutionary and Napoleonic France. He won repeated victories and upheld British pride at a time when her armies were small and achieved no success.,asimov
81,"Nelson wiped out the French fleet in Britain’s greatest naval victory in 1805 at Trafalgar on the Atlantic side of the Strait of Gibraltar. He was killed in this battle but not before he knew he was a victor.

89,"Seville is a town of southern Spain, 240 miles southwest of Madrid. The height of its prosperity came in the twelfth century when it was capital of what was left of Moorish Spain, and again in the sixteenth century when it benefited from the trade that came after the Spanish exploration and conquests in the Americas. Byron visited it in 1809 during his coming-of-age European tour.",asimov

93,"“Don,” from the Latin |||italics|||dominus|||/italics||| (master), was used as a title first by Spanish noblemen, then by anyone who was of the gentry, and finally by anyone who could get away with it (like the English “mister”).",asimov
94,"The word |||italics|||hidalgo|||/italics||| meaning, literally, “son of something” implied that a person was of honorable descent and could therefore use “Don” before his name. Since parts of Spain had been under the domination of Moors for seven centuries, and since during that time, the Jews made up a strong and prosperous minority, in the Moorish portions at least, there had been interbreeding between the native Christian Spaniards and the others. It was a point of honor among the Spanish nobility of later times that no Moors or Jews were to be found in |||italics|||their|||/italics||| ancestry.",asimov
95,"Before the invading Moors conquered Spain in 711, Spain had for three centuries been under the rule of a Gothic tribe called the Visigoths. To be able to trace one’s ancestry beyond the Moorish era to the Visigoths themselves would, of course, be the last word in Spanish nobility.",asimov
96,"Byron, who valued women for parts other than their brains, detested female intellectuals. This feeling of his was strengthened, broadened, deepened, and intensified by the fact that Lady Byron (nee Annabella Milbanke) with whom he had contracted a brief and disastrous marriage, followed by an even more disastrous (for Byron) separation that led to his permanent exile, was a “learned lady.” There seems no question but that Byron’s picture of Don Juan’s mother is intended as a satire on Lady Byron.",asimov
97,Pedro Calderón de la Barca (1600–1681) was the greatest Spanish dramatist of his times. To know all of him by heart was quite a feat since he wrote something like two hundred plays.,asimov
98,"Lope de Vega (1562–1635) preceded Calderón and was even more prolific — indeed, one of the most prolific writers of all time for he is supposed to have written over two thousand plays, of which nearly five hundred survive.

103,"In Byron’s time it was customary to leave “damn” unspelled out to avoid trouble with the censor. Obviously, the inclusion of two letters and the necessity of rhyme makes the word unmistakable, but censorship is characteristically concerned with form rather than reason.",asimov
104,"Sir Samuel Romilly (1757–1818) was an English lawyer who was a liberal and a reformer. He sympathized with the French Revolution and labored all his life in the cause of law reform against the blind opposition of the forces of post-Napoleonic reaction.
When his wife died on October 29, 1818, he found life unbearable and committed suicide in distraction on November 2, the day after Byron completed the first canto. Presumably, Byron went back to insert this heartless stanza. He might have sympathized with Sir Samuel for his liberal principles, but he had retained Sir Samuel as his lawyer in the separation proceedings and Sir Samuel had then (with rather shifty ethics) slid over to Lady Byron’s side. Byron could not forgive him this.",asimov

Harrison earned the reward fairly, but Parliament proved monumentally cheap in attempting to deny it to him and finally gave in only at the direct intervention of George III.",asimov
110,"In the early nineteenth century, an oil was imported into England derived from certain trees that grew in the vicinity of Macassar, the capital of the island of Celebs in the East Indies. Because it was from the fabled islands of the Far East, it was considered exotic and it received the hard sell as a specific guarding against baldness, in which respect it was (according to the impartial merchants who were profiting from its sale) “incomparable.”
Macassar oil became so commonly used and heads became so ineffably greasy as a result that special napkins had to be draped on overstuffed chairs and sofas to prevent the drenching of the upholstery. These are the “antimacassars,” a name still used today though the oil has long since gone into deserved oblivion.",asimov

113,"In an unfinished preface to the first to cantos of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||, first published in 1901, Byron asks the reader to suppose that “the following epic Narrative is told by a Spanish Gentleman in a village in the Sierra Morena.” While it is quite clear that Byron, throughout the poem, frequently uses the first person to represent himself, at this point the “I” takes direct part in the action and may be supposed to be the “Spanish Gentleman” who is telling the story. This affectation is quickly dropped.",asimov
114,"In the entire epic there is only one event that can be dated and that is the siege of Izmail in Cantos VII and VIII. This took place in 1790 and if Juan was then eighteen, as he might have been, he would have been born in 1772. However, Byron pays no attention to dates at all, and it is enough to know that the time of the poem is pre-Napoleonic but not much so.",asimov

116,"Among the ancient Greeks, the Spartans most affected stern military virtue. Their warriors were trained to battle from childhood and the Spartan wife ideally expected her husband to return “with his shield or on it.” Since a Spartan could only retreat effectively if he discarded his heavy shield, the phrase called for no retreat — her husband must return victorious with his shield or as a dead body borne on it.",asimov

The two parts were never again separated but the memory of the distinction between them long lingered.",asimov
123,"Classical education, dealing with ancient Latin literature and such Greek literature as survived, had, as its brightest items, three great epics.

The |||italics|||Aeneid|||/italics||| was written some eight centuries or so after the Homeric poems by the Latin poet Publius Vergilius Maro (70–19 B.C.), commonly known as Vergil. It was in direct imitation of Homer and dealt with the wanderings of the Trojan hero Aeneas after the fall of Troy.",asimov
124,"While the epic poets were, for the most part, straitlaced enough, the lyricists and satirists of pre-Christian Greece and Rome took unabashed joy in the pleasures of wine and sex, as Byron (who resembled them in this) loved to point out. Publius Ovidius Naso (43 B.C.–A.D. 17), commonly known as Ovid, wrote a book called |||italics|||The Art of Love|||/italics||| that was so erotic that it led to the poet’s exile by the moralistic Emperor Augustus.",asimov
125,"Anacreon (572–488 B.C.) was a Greek lyric poet, whose short odes celebrated love and wine.",asimov
126,Gaius Valerius Catullus (84–54 B.C.) was the greatest of the Roman lyricists and wrote a series of erotic poems to a woman who apparently did not require his love.,asimov
127,Sappho (about 600 B.C.) was the greatest of the Greek lyric poets. Very little of her work survives but the ancients thought of her as comparable to Homer. Her lyrics to girls causes her to be suspected of homosexuality. It is from the face that she lived on the island of Lesbos that “lesbianism” has come to signify female homosexuality.,asimov
128,"Dionysius Cassius Longinus (213–273) was supposed to have been the author of a treatise, |||italics|||On the Sublime|||/italics|||.

129,"In addition to the |||italics|||Aeneid|||/italics|||, Vergil wrote shorter poems, including a series of pastorals, in several of which Corydon appears ad a lovesick shepherd. In the one that begins |||italics|||“Formosum Pastor Corydon”|||/italics||| (The handsome shepherd, Corydon), Corydon is in love with a beautiful boy. The classic poets had no objection to homosexuality and neither had Byron, who was bisexual. Undoubtedly, Byron took pleasure in calling the attention of his readers to this work.",asimov

His views were considered horribly atheistic in Christian times.",asimov

146,By 1232 the Christian kingdoms of northern Spain had extended their power over almost the whole of the peninsula. Left in Moorish hands was only a small section of southern Spain centered around the city of Granada. This kingdom of Granada maintained itself for two and a half centuries not capitulating to the combined power of Castille and Aragon (see note 122) till 1492.,asimov
147,"Abu-‘Abdullah (called Boabdil by the Spaniards) was the last King of Granada. When defeated in 1492 and forced to cross over into Africa, he paused on a hill outside Granada to look back one last time at the city which had been Moorish for nearly eight centuries. The spot from which he looked back is called “El Último Suspiro del Moro” (The Last Sigh of the Moor), and as he wept, his mother said harshly, “You do well to weep like a woman for what you could not defend like a man.”",asimov
148,"One of the terms of the surrender of Granada was that Moors who remained in Spain would be accorded freedom of worship. The Christian zeal of the Spanish priesthood in succeeding decades made the promise a mockery. By 1525 the Moors were forced either to convert or to leave. Even the converted Moors remained suspect, however, and were constantly hounded under the suspicion of being secretly Mohammedan and in league with the African states south of the Mediterranean.
Finally, in 1609, they were forced out of Spain and the country lost nearly a million of its most industrious and capable citizens, serving thus its own ruin. By then, however, there had been numerous intermarriages and many Spaniards could find traces of Moorish ancestry — if they looked.",asimov
149,"There was a great deal of cousin-marriage in Byron’s family. But that was not all. Perhaps the most scandalous item in the Byronic array of scandal was the fact that Byron seems to have made his half sister, Augusta, his mistress, and to have had a daughter by her. He was fascinated by his own action in this respect and dealt with incest over and over in his writing. He enjoys hinting at it here, no doubt.",asimov

151,"St. Anthony (250–355) was the first Christian monk and the first to practice extreme asceticism. Fleeing to the solitude of the desert in order to escape the temptations of the world, he nevertheless found himself tempted by the devil. Many legends clustered about his memory concerning the manner of those temptations and the heroic measures taken by Anthony to counteract them. However, snow in the Egyptian desert, where Anthony resided, is hard to come by, and actually it was St. Francis who used the cold of ice to overcome the heat of lust, something Byron refers to later in the poem (see note 628).",asimov
152,"Was Byron thinking of his vicious nurse, May Gray (see note 140)? If so, those real life caresses were by no means “innocently done” and in view of Byron’s later sexual problems could scarcely have been “harmless.”",asimov
153,"When Byron was sixteen, he was very much in love with Mary Chaworth who was then nineteen. Nothing ever came of it for, as Miss Chaworth told her maid, “Do you think I could care anything for that lame boy?” Byron may have overheard and his sensitivity over his lameness made this cold rebuff all the worse. Juan’s success as a sixteen-year-old certainly makes up in the poem for Byron’s failure as a sixteen-year-old in reality.
A number of Byron’s love affairs, by the way, were with women older than himself. Lady Oxford, or instance, who was his mistress in 1812, was sixteen years older than he.",asimov

Tarquinus Sextus raped a chaste Roman matron, Lucretia, who killed herself out of shame, in consequence.

She fell instantly and helplessly in love with Jason the Argonaut, when he came adventuring to Colchis in search of the Golden Fleece. She helped him gain it from her own father and then fled with him, killing her younger brother on the way. When Jason tired of her in favor of a younger woman, she killed her own children by him in order to punish him.

163,"March is the rutting season for hares when, driven by sexual passion, they are at once unusually bold and unusually erratic. Comparing their behavior in March with that in other months, men find them mad so that “mad as a March hare” has become a common phrase. Byron implies that the end of spring is a kind of rutting season for women.",asimov
164,"A houri was a nymph who was imagined by Moslems to exist in Heaven for the delectation of the faithful. Houris were ever-beautiful and ever-willing, yet managed to be ever-virginal as well and (if they desired) ever-fruitful. No mention is made of intelligence.",asimov

167,A louis was a gold coin first issued by Louis XII of France in 1640 and was the rough equivalent of the English pound. The French revolutionaries no longer coined it after 1795.,asimov
168,"Xerxes I (519–465 B.C.) was the King of Persia who led an enormous army into Greece and was defeated at the battle of Salamis (see note 371) in 480 B.C.
After the battle, he retired to his capital and to his harem, and there he stayd for the remainder of his reign, leaving the war to his regional governors and his generals.
The power and luxury of a monarch of the giant Persian empire was enormous and seemed all the greater to the inhabitants of the small Greek city-states, since their own accumulations of wealth were, of necessity, much smaller. Xerxes therefore became the personification of the luxurious pleasure seeker.",asimov
169,"Aristotle (384–322 B.C.) was the most famous of the Greek philosophers (except perhaps for his teacher, Plato). From those parts of his writings on drama that have survived, men have gleaned Aristotle’s thinking on its rules: that tragedies were concerned with kings and famous men and comedies, with common folk.
He also believed in the tightness of plotting, in the “unities.” He felt a play had to have unity of action — a single plot with no incident that did not contribute to its advancement. It must also have a unity of time and of place — the action must take place within twenty-four hours and in a single setting.
Needless to say, Aristotle’s rules are by no means essential to great drama; Shakespeare broke them all in almost every play. Byron’s pretended adherence to them here is meant ironically, for |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| is as un-Aristotelian in this respect as it is possible to be.",asimov
170,"Adria is an ancient town in northern Italy, near the Po delta. It was founded by the Etruscans while Rome was as yet a village. It was originally on the Adriatic Sea, which was named for it, and was its most important port. With the silting up of the harbor by the Po River, this aspect of its existence vanished. The city is now thirteen miles inland. The name can be applied, poetically, to Venice, founded at least a thousand years after Adria was, and some twenty-five miles to its north. Byron was living in Venice while he wrote these lines, and while there he surely could not help but hear the gondoliers, who traditionally sing as they row.",asimov
171,"“Bacchanal” is an adjective derived from Bacchus, the Greek god of wine.",asimov
172,"While in exile, Byron looked forward with considerable anticipation to the death of his mother-in-law, Lady Judith Milbanke, from whom he expected to inherit a considerable legacy. She did finally die in 1822 (four years after these lines were written) at the age of seventy-one. Byron inherited an income of £3,000 a year — a fortune in the Italy of those days. Lady Judith’s maiden name was Noel, and Byron added that to his own name in order to qualify for the inheritance, becoming George Gordon Noel Byron.",asimov
173,"“Us youth” is the famous cry of Falstaff in Shakespeare’s |||italics|||Henry IV, Part One|||/italics||| who, aged and fat, nevertheless retained a relish for the vices associated with youthful roguery. Thus, when Falstaff and some of his cronies hold up and rob a group of merchants, Falstaff places himself on the youthful side of the generation gap, crying out against the victims and in defense of his own actions: “They hate us youth” (II, ii, 85).",asimov
174,"Byron was markedly anti-Semitic, which shows up in various places in |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| and which represents a flaw in his liberal views. His anti-Semitism, however, was specialized and directed against moneylenders. While young men of good family were denied the money held by the older members of that same family, they could borrow money on their expectations, with the promise of repaying principle, plus a healthy interest, after the old have died and the money has been inherited. Such a deal is a “post-obit,” short for |||italics|||post obitum|||/italics||| which is Latin for “after death.” Byron began borrowing in college, was thousands of pounds in debt before he was twenty-one, and stayed in debt almost all his life.
Naturally, the moneylenders were at the door immediately upon news of the ancient’s death, since it would not take long for the inheritor to squander their money or to make way abroad without paying. Most of the young men involved, Byron included, saw no harm in trying to avoid repaying the money they had borrowed, whether to moneylenders or to tradesmen. It was the aristocratic thing to do, for we must remember that the aristocratic sense of honor was a specialized thing, usually granted only to other aristocrats and that parsimoniously. The inheritors naturally scorned and even hated the mercenary wretches who were so greedy as to want their own money back (plus the high interest made necessary by the playful aristocratic habit of defaulting). Since many of the English moneylenders of the period were Jews, it was on their heads that resentment such as Byron’s particularly fell.",asimov
175,It is sometimes maintained (and Byron apparently does so here) that the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge symbolized the discovery by Adam and Eve of the sexual act.,asimov
176,"Prometheus, in the Greek myths, was a Titan who, having created the human race, took pity on its miserable state, since Zeus denied it the necessary knowledge for elementary comfort. Prometheus therefore stole fire from the sun and gave it to mankind. The angered Zeus punished Prometheus by chaining him to Mount Caucasus in what was, to the Greeks, the Far East, and arranging to have an eagle (or vulture) gnaw ceaselessly at his liver.",asimov
177,"Byron’s dilettantish interest in scientific advance shows up in several places in |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics|||, as here, for instance. The “new noses” is not a reference to plastic surgery, but to some quack remedy highly touted in Byron’s time for curing everything right down to red noses.",asimov
178,"The use of the guillotine was first proposed in 1789 by a French physician, Joseph Ignace Guillotin (1738–1814), after whom it was named. Actually, it was a humane device producing instant and presumably painless death, in place of the executioner’s ax, which sometimes missed, with horrible results.",asimov
179,"Sir William Congreve (1772–1828) introduced the use of rocket artillery to the west. It was used by the British armed forces in the War of 1812 against the United States, specifically in the bombarding of Fort McHenry in Baltimore. It was on this occasion that Francis Scott Key (1779–1843) wrote “The Star-Spangled Banner” which includes the phrase “the rockets’ red glare.” Rockets were also used in 1813 at the battle of Leipzig where Napoleon was defeated. Rockets were soon overtaken by improvements in conventional artillery and dropped out of use, only to return in World War II.",asimov
180,"The English physician Edward Jenner (1749–1823) observed that those who contracted the disease known as cowpox (or, in Latin, |||italics|||vaccinia|||/italics||| from |||italics|||vacca|||/italics||| meaning “cow”) were not only immune to attacks of cowpox thereafter but seemed to be immune to the much more serious disease of smallpox as well. In 1796, therefore, he performed the experiment of deliberately injecting a young boy with fluid from a cowpox blister. This gave the boy cowpox. When he recovered, he was inoculated with fluid from a smallpox blister — and nothing happened. The process of protecting against smallpox by the use of cowpox is “vaccination.”",asimov
181,"In 1771 an Italian anatomist, Luigi Galvani (1737–1798) noted that an electric shock would cause dead muscles to contract, an effect called “galvanism” in his honor. This roused great interest since it seemed to imply there was a life principle in electricity and offered the hope that somehow life might be restored to a dead body. Indeed, in 1803 Galvani’s nephew Giovanni Aldini (1762–1834) experimented with the use of electric shocks on the body of a hanged murderer.
In 1816 Byron, after having left England, but before he came to Italy, had spent time on the shores of Lake Geneva, with Persey Bysshe Shelley (1792–1822), Shelley’s mistress, Mary Godwin (1792–1851), and some others. They talked about galvanism one night and all agreed to write what we would today call science fiction stories. Only Mary Godwin (who married Shelley shortly after) came through. She wrote the famous |||italics|||Frankenstein,|||/italics||||||italics||| published in 1818.|||/italics|||",asimov
182,"The Royal Humane Society, founded in 1758, taught methods of artificial respiration for those who seemed drowned, with the result that not a few were saved. Artificial respiration was thus more effective in restoring life (though, to be sure, the former worked only when life had not yet departed in the first place).",asimov
183,"The “great pox” is syphilis, a disease which, in the days of vaccination, Byron had more cause to fear than smallpox.",asimov
184,"There is reference to syphilis by European writers before the time of Columbus, but the first real epidemic of the disease was only reported after Columbus’s return from America. This, combined with the fact that evidence of syphilis has been found in the bones of pre-Columbian indians, has led to the theory that Columbus’s sailors picked up syphilis from Indian women and brought it back to Europe. (On the other hand, it may be that there was merely a change of names; that what Europeans called syphilis in modern times, they had called “leprosy” in the Middle Ages.)",asimov
185,"The English economist Thomas Robert Malthus (1766–1834) wrote an epoch-making book |||italics|||An Essay on the Principle of Population|||/italics||| in 1798 and was the first to point out the danger of overpopulation and the necessity of lowering the birth rate. Byron was fascinated by this and refers to the matter several times in |||italics|||Don Juan.|||/italics||| (The Industrial Revolution postponed the Malthusian nemesis and allowed a quadrupling of the world’s population since 1800 — so that the danger, when it returned in the mid-twentieth century, is now worse than ever.)",asimov
186,"|||italics|||Lues|||/italics|||, a Latin word meaning “plague,” is sometimes used as a synonym for syphilis.",asimov
187,"In the mining coal there was sometimes an accumulation of inflammable methane gas. The use of open candle flames to guide miners in the dark depths was an invitation to sometimes disastrous explosions. In 1815 the English chemist Sir Hamphrey Davy (1778–1829), a friend of Byron’s, devised a system for enclosing the candle flame in wire gauze. The metal radiated heat quickly so that beyond it the ignition temperature was not reached. This “Davy lamp” was an enormous contribution to mine safety.",asimov
188,"Tombouctou (the official spelling fot the town most often known in English as Timbuktu) is located in what is now the nation of Mali, along the middle reaches of the Niger River. It was once a center for caravan routes across the Sahara and about 1500 was the capital of the Songhoi empire, a black realm. In 1590 the Songhoi empire was destroyed by Moroccan forces who used firearms, but its distant memory held an exotic fascination for Europeans. In Byron’s time, Europeans were just beginning to explore the African interior, and word of Tombouctou appeared, for instance, in a book entitled |||italics|||An Account of the Empire of Morocco|||/italics||| by James Grey Jackson, published 1809. The city was not actually reached, however, till 1826 (eight years after these lines were written), when the Scottish explorer Alexander Gordon Laing (1793–1826) arrived there and was promptly killed by Arab traders.",asimov
189,"As soon as it was understood that the earth was a rotating sphere, it was also understood that it had to possess a North Pole and a South Pole. Reaching either across wildernesses of snow and ice was a problem, however. Explorers slowly worked their way further and further northward and southward and in Byron’s time were only five hundred miles short of the North Pole and eleven hundred miles short of the south. These explorations were brought to public attention by books on polar exploration written by Sir John Ross (1777–1856), published in 1819, and by Sir William Edward Parry (1790–1855), published in 1820, not long after the first part of |||italics|||Don Juan|||/italics||| was published. The poles themselves, however, were not reached for nearly a century after Byron’s time.",asimov
190,"The battle of Waterloo, fought on June 18, 1815, was, in Byron’s time, and for a century after, a kind of military watershed. It was the battle at which Napoleon’s power had been broken once and for all, and the battle at which Great Britain’s military prestige reached its all-time high point. Byron viewed Waterloo as a defeat, however, for by it the reactionary monarchs of Europe were enabled to turn the clock back and erase the advances toward freedom begun by the French Revolution.",asimov
191,"A |||italics|||cortejo|||/italics||| is, literally, a suitor, but it is generally used to represent the recognized lover of a lady, one who has the tacit approval of the husband, but who carefully maintains the appearance of respectability.",asimov
192,"Most of the individuals mentioned by Donna Julia in this passage are fictitious, but the Irish soldier Alexander O’Reilly (1722–1794) was a lieutenant general in the Spanish army. In 1768 he put down a revolt in the Louisiana Territory with considerable cruelty.",asimov
193,"O’Reilly never took Algiers, however. He assaulted the city in 1775 but was driven back with the loss of four thousand men. It was not till 1830, a dozen years after these lines were written, that Algiers was taken. Then it was by French forces who thus established the beginning of the French African empire that was to last for a century and a quarter.",asimov
194,"There was indeed a Count Giambattista Corniani (1742–1813) of this period, but he was a harmless historian of Italian literature and is surely not referred to here. Probably the name is used as a play on |||italics|||cornuto,|||/italics||| the Italian word for “cuckold.” The name, Cazzani, two lines before may be a play on the Italian vilgarism |||italics|||cazzo|||/italics|||, meaning “penis.”",asimov

199,"George, Duke of Clarence (1449–1478), was a younger brother of King Edward IV of England. He was accused of secretly plotting against the King’s life, was convicted, and was imprisoned in the Tower. There he was secretly executed. A legend arose later to the effect that he was drowned in a butt of malmsey (that is, in a barrel of a variety of sweet wine produced from malvasia grapes). Shakespeare used Clarence’s end as the major event in the first act of his play |||italics|||Richard III|||/italics|||.",asimov
200,"The incident referred to here took place when David was seventy and suffered from chills. His servants said to him: “Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin:and let her stand before the king and let her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get heat” (I Kings 1:2). David lived, as Byron says, but not for very long, for he dies in the next chapter.",asimov
201,"In 1240 Europe was invaded by the Mongols, or Tatars. Of all the barbarian invasions from the east, this was the most rapid and the most deadly. The Tatars eventually retreated, but only because the death of their king made it necessary to be on hand to elect a new one. They never returned, but Europeans received a scare they never forgot. The word “Tatar” was converted to “Tartar,” for the invaders seemed so irresistible and evil as to be demons from Tartarus, the section of Hades reserved for the torture of evil-doers in the Greek myths. The word “tartar” came to be applied to any person capable of doing great harm in his fits of anger.",asimov
202,"When Joseph was sold as a slave in Egypt, he served in the house of Potiphar. Potiphar’s wife fell in love with him and wanted him to make love to her, but the virtuous Joseph refused: “And she caught him by the garment, saying, Lie with me: and he left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out” (Genesis 39:12).",asimov

In 429 they had a chance to leave Spain for virgin fields in North Africa. This they did and carved out a kingdom for themselves, with Carthage as their capital, that was to last for a century.",asimov

A visit to Hell would therefore be a natural part of the hero’s adventures in any epic. Since Byron maintains that |||italics|||Don Juan |||/italics|||is an epic and since Don Juan in the original tale goes to Hell at the end, he promises such a scene. However, the promise never came to pass (too bad!) partly because Byron never really finished the poem and partly because Byron’s aims shifted.",asimov

209,"John Dryden (1631–1700) was an English poet who, like Byron, wrote satiric epics, notably |||italics|||Absalom and Achiophel|||/italics||| in 1681 and |||italics|||The Hind and Panther|||/italics||| in 1687. Byron may have liked the poetry, but it is odd that he did not take notice of the fact that, unlike Milton (see note 31), Dryden was an apostate. He turned from his Puritan background to Catholicism.",asimov
210,"Alexander Pope (1688–1744) was an English poet, undersized and deformed (but with giant wit and intelligence), who wrote mock-heroic epics such as |||italics|||The Rape of the Lock |||/italics|||in 1712. He wrote almost entirely in couplets and was, of all English poets, the only one who may have been Byron’s superior in the savagery of his wit. Byron admired Pope more than any other poet and Byron’s first satire |||italics|||English Bards and Scotch Reviewers|||/italics||| (1809) was a deliberate, and effective, piece of writing in the style of Pope. (Other poets mentioned in this stanza were dealt with in the Dedication.)",asimov
211,William Sotheby was a minor literary figure whom Byron disliked. He believed Sotheby to have been the author of an anonymous and unfavorable review condemning Byron’s |||italics|||Prisoner of Chillon|||/italics|||. The surest way to worm one’s self into Byron’s disfavor was to criticize his poetry (something in which Byron closely resembles all other literary figures I have ever heard of).,asimov

213,"The |||italics|||Aeneid|||/italics||| and |||italics|||Paradise Lost|||/italics||| had twelve books (or cantos) each, while the |||italics|||Iliad|||/italics||| and |||italics|||Odyssey|||/italics||| had twenty-four apiece. Thus, either twelve or twenty-four seemed natural in an epic. Here, Byron is thinking of twelve, with the twelfth and last reserved for the climactic scene in Hell. (Byron surveying Hell, à la Dante, and inventing clever tortures for all the people in past history whom he disliked would have made fascinating reading — but, never mind, it was never to be.)",asimov
214,"The |||italics|||British Review|||/italics||| was, of course, not really bribed; this was just Byron’s idea of a joke. (His sense of fun sometimes overstepped the bounds of what most people would consider good taste.) The shocked and humorless editor of the periodical protested his innocence vigorously, but no doubt that just added to the fun.",asimov
215,"In 1802 the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review|||/italics||| was founded and issued in a buff-and-blue cover indicating its sympathies with the Whig Party. Its reviewers pulled no punches and when they disliked something, often enjoyed showing their own brilliance at the expense of the one they were pillorying (an occupational disease of critics which coses them uncounted friends). In 1807, when Byron was only nineteen, he published his first volume of poetry, |||italics|||Hours of Idleness|||/italics|||, and this was instantly seized upon by the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review,|||/italics||| which treated its author “very martyrly” indeed.
The review, published anonymously in the Hanuary 1808 issue, was by Henry Peter Brougham (see note 942), one of the founders of the journal, and Byron never forgave him once he discovered the identity of the author.

216,"In 1809 dissatisfaction with the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review|||/italics||| led to the founding of a competing periodical, with Tory sympathies, in London.

It was just as apt to overkill its targets as the |||italics|||Edinburgh Review|||/italics||| was.",asimov
217,"This passage from Horace means “I would not have borne this in my flaming youth while Plancus was consul.” Plancus was Lucius Munatius Plancus, who was consul in 42 B.C. when Horace was twenty-three years old. Byron indicates that this means that he himself would have been a lot readier to resent a hostile review six or seven years earlier when he was twenty-three. And so he was (see note 215), but the implication that he had attained to the coolness of age now that he was thirty was an exaggerated one — his resentment of adverse criticism and his habit of returning the blow with all his might never cooled.",asimov
218,"The Brenta River in northeastern Italy flows into the Adriatic Sea about twenty miles south of Venice. Byron was an inveterate, and brilliant, letter writer, and these letters he was now “dating” from his exile at a summer villa, seven miles inland on the left bank of Brenta.",asimov
219,"Byron’s “flaming youth” of twenty-three (by Horatian standards) was in 1811, when George III was still king. It was in that year that George’s madness became so unmistakable that he was declared unfit to rule and the actual power turned over to his son as Regent. Of course, the old madman was still alive when Byron wrote these line and was to live (and theoretically be king) for some two more years.",asimov
220,"Alas, Byron was never to know. He died before he was thirty-seven.",asimov
221,"Roger Bacon (1214–1294) was an English scholar who was ahead of his time. He believed in experimentation, could make gunpowder and spectacles, dabbled in alchemy, and was greatly feared as a wizard. Tales were told of him in the aftertime that grew better in the telling. One of these is found in |||italics|||Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay|||/italics|||, the chief work of the English dramatist Robert Greene (1560–1592).
This take deals with a brazen head that Bacon had devised, one that could speak and, presumably, tell hidden things. Bacon watched for the head to speak, but sleep overcame him. While he slept, the head spoke. It said “Time is,” then half an hour later, “Time was,” and then, after yet another half hour, said “Time is past” and shattered. Only then, too late, did Bacon awake.
The tale symbolizes the fleeting of time and the lost opportunities that plague all men. Byron uses it to sigh over his lost youth (“chymic” means “alchemic” here with a back-reference to Bacon), so much of it gone in dissipation and folly, and seems to have a presentiment of his early death.",asimov
222,"The ancient Egyptian pyramids were built in order to preserve the ruler’s mummy and the artifacts buried with it so that all (and the nation it represented) might exist in afterlife. To foil grave robbers, the pyramids were made ever larger and more complex. The largest and most complex of all was built under Cheops (or, more correctly, Khufu) who reigned about 2600 B.C.
